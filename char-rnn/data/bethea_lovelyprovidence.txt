When I think of love, I think of Providence
And its 3 rivers.
Love, like the history of these waters starts out wild and free
Untamed, unashamed
Completely at ease in its beauty
Love, like these waters changes over time
Gets covered up, or loses its way
And though you hope to hold on to some essential essence of yourself,
You can’t help but be changed…

When I think about love, and the way it changes
I think about the Jewelry District.
The Jewelry district to me is a story of manufacturing heartbreak
A belle of the ball who has lost her party
Prettied with her Greek Revival and Federal style buildings
Left to sit with only her memories
“Did you know that some of the biggest manufacturing plants in the country were here?” She’ll say to anyone
who cares to listen.
“Did you know how many men came to call on me? They came from places like Ireland, Germany, Portugal,
Italy, Sweden, Cape Verde, and more places too numerous to name…”
Far into the night she could bask in her memories of the early 1900s,
Closing her eyes when she mentioned the devastation of the Great Depression
Opening them slowly when she described the flurry of WWII
Closing them again, keeping them closed when talking about tomorrow’s hope for a
Knowledge District.
Because a woman whose heart has been deeply broken knows not to
Hope freely.

When I think of love and the need for hope,
I think of Water Place Park,
Three rivers once closed
Now open
Now adorned
With architecture, waterfires and casual passersbyers.
And I want to tell my Jewelry District belle, my South Providence belle, my Pawtucket and Central Falls belles
To remember that love lives in renaissance
Not in decay.
Because love is wild and free, unashamed, untamed.
