Blackstone is a predominantly residential neighborhood in Providence, Rhode
Island. It is in the northeast corner of the city and is bounded to the south
and west by Lloyd Avenue and Hope Street respectively. It is one of six
neighborhoods comprising the East Side of Providence.

Blackstone is one of the newest parts of Providence, as the remoteness of its
location and marshy land had precluded significant development before the late
19th century. The area's connection to the rest of the city improved when a
second public horse car line was completed, though it was the completion of the
landscaped Blackstone Boulevard in 1894 that triggered rapid development in the
area. The 20th century saw institutional development in the form of Central
Baptist Church, Temple Emanuel, and St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church.
According to the Providence Plan,a local nonprofit aimed at improving city life,
92.5% of residents are white, well above the city-wide average of 54.5%.

Blackstone is one of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city with a median
family income nearly four times that of the city and housing values more than
doubling in recent years. The median household income is $87,727, and the median
family income is $117,522. Only 1.1% of families live below the poverty line.

Blackstone Boulevard Park is a green space between northbound and southbound
lanes of Blackstone Boulevard. It consists of 19.3 acres of parkland
and a 1.7-mile jogging/walking path.

Lippitt Memorial Park is located at the intersection of Hope Street and Blackstone Boulevard near the Pawtucket border.
