The black ghinkos snarl their way up
the moon growls at each blinking window
the apartment houses climb deafeningly into the purple

    A bat hisses northwards
    the perilous steps lead to a grate
    suddenly the heat is bearable

The cross-eyed dog scratches a worn patch of pavement
his right front leg is maimed in the shape of a V
there’s no trace of his nails on the street a woman cajoles

    She is very old and dirty
    she whistles her filthy hope
    that it will rain tonight

The 6th Avenue bus trunk-lumbers sideways
it is full of fat people who cough as at a movie
they eat each other’s dandruff in the flickering glare

    The moon passes into clouds
    so hurt by the street lights
    of your glance oh my heart

The act of love is also passing like a subway bison
through the paper-littered arches of the express tracks
the sailor sobers he feeds pennies to the peanut machines

    Though others are in the night
    far away lips upon a dusty armpit
    the nostrils are full of tears

High fidelity reposed in a box a hand on the windowpane
the sweet calm the violin strings tie a young man’s hair
the bright black eyes pin far away their smudged curiosity

    Yes you are foolish smoking
    the bars are for rabbits
    who wish to outlive the men
