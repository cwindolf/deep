It is the design of this book to describe briefly the interesting and most 
important public features of the city of Providence. The descriptions are 
all arranged in strictly alphabetical order, so as to afford instantaneous access 
to any subject. The material has been carefully compiled and critically 
revised. The work was done chiefly by Harry E. Manchester, a native 
of Providence, and for several years past clerk in the office of the Superin- 
tendent of Health. A part of the work was done by Robert Grieve, who 
was the author of several important chapters in " Picturesque Rhode Island." 
To them and to others who have assisted in its compilation, and also to the 
business men who have encouraged its publication by means of their patron- 
age, is due the gratitude of the Editor and Publisher. 



A Batch of Historical Notes. 
 In 1636 Roger Williams, with 
a few followers, exiled from the 
colony of Massachusetts for their 
religious views, crossed the See- 
konk River, exchanged saluta- 
tions with the Indians at Slate 
Rock, coasted around the head- 
land of Tockwotton, and finally 
landed near a spring of pure 
water on the banks of the Mo- 
shassuck River. Here Roger 
Williams began a settlement, 
which, in gratitude for the " Prov- 
idence of the Most Holy and 
Only Wise," he called Providence. In 1649 ^ was incorporated as a town, the north part of 
which was almost entirely de- 
stroyed by fire in 1676 by the 
Indians, during King Philip's 
war. In 1708, by the first census 
ever taken in the colony, Provi- 
dence numbered 1,446 souls, or 
about Soo less than Newport. 
The latter town never recovered 
from the effects of the Revolu- 
tion ; and the census in 1800 
returns the population of Providence as 7,614, while that of 
Newport was 6,739. The growth 
of Providence from that time has 
been steady and rapid. In 1832, 
the date of its incorporation as a 


city, it contained about iS.ooo 
inhabitants. In 1S50 this num- 
ber had increased to 41,513, in 
1870 to 68,904, and in 1880 to 
104,587. The present estimated 
population of the city is 116,000. 
This increase of over 60 per cent 
in the past 12 years is due in part 
to important annexations. In 
the succeeding pages will be 
found much historical matter per- 
taining directly to the subjects of 
the respective paragraphs. At no 
time in its history has Providence 
been more prosperous than it is 
in 1882. 

Abattoirs.  Very little 
slaughtering of cattle is done 
here ; as within the past few 
years it has been found that the 
business could be done better 
and cheaper in the "West, and the 
carcasses instead of the live ani- 
mals are now shipped East. Sev- 
eral local firms, however, have 
slaughter-houses where they kill 
sheep and hogs, and occasionally 
a few cattle. On the line of the 
Boston & Providence Railroad, 
between Providence and Paw- 
tucket, the most extensive of 
these houses are situated. The 
firms using them, each of whom 
have separate establishments, are 
I. B. Mason & Son, 98 Canal St., 
who slaughter between 40,000 and 
50,000 hogs yearly ; Comstock & 
Co., 101 Canal St., who kill about 
the same number ; and H. W. 
(lark, 99 Canal St., about 25,000 
sheep yearly. I. M. Lincoln, 112 
Canal St., has a slaughter-house 
in North Providence, in which 
from 4,000 to 5,000 cattle and 
from 15,000 to 18,000 sheep are 
annually killed. Wilbur & Ken- 
drick, 50 Canal St., at their 
slaughter-house in Olneyville kill 
annually 12,000 to 15,000 sheep. 


Abbott Park, on Broad St., 
adjoining the Beneficent Congre- 
gational Church, was conveyed, 
in 1746, by Daniel Abbott, to a 
committee of that church, "for 
public use." It contains 7,800 
sq. ft. In the centre of the lot 
stands a graceful iron fountain, 
presented to the city in 1875 by 
Wm. H. Charnley and others. 

Academies.  The chief local 
private schools or academies are 
LaSalle Academy ; Mowry and 
Goff's English and Classical 
School ; St. Francis Xavier 
Academy ; Female Seminary of 
the Sacred Heart ; School of the 
Society of Friends ; J. P. C. 
Shaw's School ; and the Univer- 
sity Grammar School. Most of 
the above are described in their 
alphabetical places. See Schools 
and also Catholic Schools. 

Academy of Music is a name 
which a few years ago signified 
in Providence a dramatic hall, in 
the present Phenix Building, at 
No. 129 Westminster St., wherein 
numerous miscellaneous perform- 
ances took place for a number of 
years. It outlived its usefulness 
when the Providence and Low's 
"opera-houses" were built, and 
left the name to be used in course 
of time by some institution which 
will be more worthy of it. 

Adams, John, the President 
of the United States, with his 
family, passed through Providence 
in August, 1797. He was escorted 
through the town by the Light 
Dragoons, and welcomed by the 
ringing of bells and the firing of 
cannon. The address presented 
to him by the citizens, and his 
reply, are printed in William R. 
Staples's " Annals of the Town 
of Providence."

Advent Christian Church, 
Hammond St., nr. Division. The 
society was org. in 1S71 with 10 
members, and worshipped in a 
hall 0:1 Broad St. until the erec- 
tion of the present edifice in the 
summer of 1S73. There have 
been four pastors since org. Pres- 
ent membership, 135 ; member- 
ship of Sunday school, 150; pas- 
tor, Norman P. Cook. 

African Union Church, 
Clayton St., belonging to the 
African Methodist Episcopal 
body, Eastern Conference, was 
founded Oct. 16, 1856; incorpo- 
rated Feb. 7, i860. The society 
worshipped in a hired room until 
1870 or 1S71, when a house near 
the upper end of Clayton St. was 
bought, and converted into a 
church, in which services have 
ever since been held. Present 
membership about 25. The pas- 
tor is Dennis Johnson. 

Agriculture.  According to 
the State Census of 1875, there 
were then in the limits of Provi- 
dence 57 farms, containing a total 
of 2,383 acres, more than one- 
half of the entire area of the 
city. Of this acreage, 324 were 
ploughed land, 96 bog-meadow, 
652 mowing-land, 673 pasture- 
land, and 567 woodland. The 
total value, including farms, 
buildings, and implements, was 
^1,910,410 ; value of live-stock, 
$41,505; of the produce of mar- 
ket-gardens, $29,855 ; of all farm- 
products, $92,070. Since 1875, 
although the city has increased 
in population, and many new 
dwellings have been erected, it is 
safe to assume that the amount 
of land under cultivation has in- 
creased rather than diminished. 
See Green-Houses. 



Akerman Company, incor- 
porated in 1881, are the proprie- 
tors of the longest-established 

and largest bindery in Rhode Isl- 
and. It was established in iN;6, 
by Charles Akerman, who had 
learned his trade at the bindery of 
the famous University Press of 
Cambridge. Its premises now in- 
clude the upper floors of the Wash- 
ington Buildings, at the corner of 
Westminster Street and Washing- 
ton Row. The main bindery-room 
is the old Mechanics' Hall, for- 
merly occupied by the Mechanics' 
Association, of which for several 
years Mr. Akerman was presi- 
dent. The specialty of this firm 
is the manufacturing of blank- 
books, pattern cards, etc. In 
1882 a job -printing office was 
added, so as to enable the Com- 
pany to make on its own premises 
the complete stationery and blank- 
book outfits for counting-rooms 
and manufactories ; and the bind- 
ing of all kinds of books for in- 
dividuals and for private and 
public libraries. Employment is 
given to about thirty-five hands, 
many of whom are old and very 
skilled workmen. The machinery 
and appliances of the establish- 
ment are of approved patterns ; so 
that, although the concern is the 
oldest, it is nevertheless thorough- 
ly equipped for the most modern 
work. The treasurer of the com- 
pany is George T. Paine, a well- 
known resident of Providence for 
many years ; and the manager is 
T. B. Rawson, who has been con- 
nected in various positions with 
the Akerman bindery for the past 
fifteen years. 

Aldermen.  See Board of 
Aldermen, and City Government,

Alfredians is a secret order 
"intended to provide for the wel- 
fare of born subjects of the lineal 
descendants of King Alfred, and 
those descended from branches 
of the same stock which have 
thrown off the political allegi- 
ance, but who rejoice to be bear- 
ers forward and the amplifiers of 
the glorious civilization inaugu- 
rated by Alfred." It has no life- 
insurance features, but provides 
" weekly sick-benefits." In Prov- 
idence there is one society called 
" Brigade No. i." It meets at 
the Knights of Pythias hall, 56 
Westminster St., the first and 
third Mondays of every month. 

All Saints' Memorial 
Church, cor. of High and Stew- 
art Sts., is a handsome speci- 
men of Gothic architecture built 
of rough Portland stone. It 
has several beautiful windows, 
noticeably the large front window 
and that of the chancel. The 
massive doors, with their elabo- 
rate and ornamental hinges of 
brass, are of oak, as is most of 
the interior wood-work. At the 
west end, facing the chancel, is a 
mural tablet in memory of the 
late Bishop Henshaw, father of 
the present rector. The society 
worshipping here was originally 
that of the old St. Andrew's 
Church, org. in 1846 ; whose 
church building, a small wooden 
structure, stood on Hospital, cor. 
Allen St., where the great gas- 
ometer now stands. In 1S54 the 
building was removed to Friend- 
ship St., near Plane St., and in 
1856 was enlarged to almost 
double its former size. The cor- 
ner-stone of the present church 
was laid in 1869 ; the first service 
was held before its completion 
at Easter, 1872 ; and the final 



consecration, under the new name, 
took place on All Saints' Day, 
1S75. Tne rector, Rev. Daniel 
Henshaw, has held the position 
for 28 years. 

Amateur Dramatic Hall, 

S. Main, cor. Power St., is a 
small hall with a stage and 
scenery adapted to private enter- 
tainments. Dramatic perform- 
ances, concerts, fairs, socials, 
etc., of a select nature, are held 
here. The building has quite a 
history : erected in 1833 for a 
church, it served the Power-st. 
Methodist Episcopal Society 
nearly 40 years, was afterwards 
used as a riding-school, and since 
1876 has been leased by the Ama- 
teur Dramatic Club. 

Annexations and Divisions. 
 Providence originally included 
in its jurisdiction nearly the 
whole of the territory now form- 
ing Providence County. As set- 
tlements were made in this region 
at a distance from Providence, 
portions were set apart and 
formed into separate townships 
as their situation and wants re- 
quired. In this manner the 
towns of Gloucester, Smithfield, 
and Scituate were set off Feb. 20, 
1730-31 ; Cranston, June 14, 1754; 
Johnston, March 6, 1759; and 
North Providence, June 13, 1765. 
The other towns in the county, as 
at present existing, were either 
formed by divisions of these just 
mentioned or by annexations of 
Massachusetts territory. Por- 
tions of the town of Cranston 
were annexed to Providence, June 
10, 1868, and March 28, 1873. 
Portions of North Providence 
were annexed June 29, 1767, 
and also March 28, 1873, ar >d May 
1, 1874.

Arcade, The, serves as a 
pleasant and convenient passage- 
way from Westminster to Wey- 
bosset St. It is a large granite 
building, lighted by a glass-cov- 
ered central court. It was erect- 
ed in 1S28, in the Ionic style, and 
divided into three stories of 26 
stores each. At either end of 
the building stairways lead to 
galleries around the upper floors. 
As it is a much-frequented thor- 
oughfare, it is a favorite place for 
retail stores, especially those in 
the millinery, fancy-goods, and 
kindred trades. Its cost was 
about $140,000. 

Area of Providence.  See 

Providence. 

Arion Club, The, org. in 
1880, has about 160 active mem- 
bers, both ladies and gentlemen, 
and about 300 associate members. 
The music practised is of a high 
order, and the concerts given by 
this society have been some of 
the most enjoyable ever heard 
in Providence. Jules Jordan is 
director. 

Arsenal, Benefit, nr. Meeting 
St. This gloomy structure of 
plastered stone, with its two cas- 
tellated towers, was built in 1840 
for a State Arsenal. Since the 
distribution of arms and munition 
in various parts of the State, it 
has been leased to the Providence 
Marine Corps of Artillery as an 
armory. 

Art Club, The Providence, 

occupies a pleasant suite of rooms 
at 35^ N. Main St. It was org. 
in 18S0, and has at present a mem- 
bership of nearly 250. The inter- 
ests of art are promoted by 
meetings for mutual discussion 



course of entertainments during 
the season. Occasionally loan 
exhibitions are held. A reading- 
room supplies the latest art intel- 
ligence. Admission on invitation 
by members. Yearly tax $6.00.

Athenaeum, The, College St., 
cor. Benefit, occupies a small and 
handsome granite building of the 
Grecian temple pattern. It stands 
upon a terrace approached by 
two flights of steps, bet. which is 
a drinkmg-fountain (see Drinking- 
Fountains), and consists of a main 
story and a basement. The main 
floor holds the library collection 
of 40,000 vols.; the reading-room 
occupies the basement, which, 
from the slope of College St., 
is of good height. Paintings, 
statues, busts, curiosities, etc., 
adorn the rooms. Nicholas 
Brown and the heirs of Thomas 
P. Ives, in 1836, offered the lot, 
$6,000 for a building, $4,000 for 
books ; provided sums of $10,000 
for a building and $4,000 for 
books should be raised. This 
was done, and the edifice com- 
pleted late in 1837. The Athe- 
naeum corporation, formed in 
1836, was the outgrowth of two 
library associations,  the Provi- 
dence, which established about 
1754 the first library in Provi- 
dence ; and the Providence Athe- 
naeum, chartered in 1831. The 
Athenaeum stock is divided into 
699 shares, held by 685 indi- 
viduals.

Mrs. Anna Richmond. It bears 
the date of erection, " A. D. 1S73," 
and the inscription, " Come hither

Auton House, Recollections 
of, is the title of a most enter- 
taining and uniquely illustrated 
book for children, published in 
1SS1 by Houghton, Mifflin, & Co. 
of Boston. The book is more 
truth than fiction, and is a won- 
derfully interesting sketch of 
scenes in early life, which are 
supposed to have occurred in 
what, not many years ago, was a 
stately mansion at the cor. of 
Westminster and Walnut Sts. in 
Providence. The book and illus- 
trations are nominally by C. 
Auton, a name which is merely a 
play on the Greek ceavrov or 
"himself;" the C. Auton being 
Augustus Hoppin, a prominent 
local artist, a son of Thos. C. Hop- 
pin, at whose home the scenes 
are supposed to have taken place. 

Bank Clerks' Mutual Bene- 
fit Association, The, org. in 
1871, is composed of cashiers and 
clerks of the local banking-insti- 
tutions. It holds an annual meet- 
ing and banquet in April, and 
other business and social meetings 
during the year. Its insurance 
feature provides for an allowance 
to members or their heirs of from 
$500 to $1,200 in case of perman- 
ent disability or death. Francis

Banking Institutions. The 
first bank established in Provi- 
dence was the " Providence," 
which was incorp'd in 179 1. It 
was started by wealthy merchants, 
who were moved to do so by ob- 
serving '"the great advantages 
which had resulted to Boston 
from the bank established there." 
This institution has continued in 
existence from that time until the 
present. June, 1865, it was re- 
org'd as a national bank by the 
name " Providence National 
Bank." In 1819 the Providence 
Institution for Savings was 
incorp'd by the General Assem- 
bly, and since then has enjoyed a 
career of great prosperity, having 
a reputation at present of being 
one of the safest institutions of 
the kind in the country. Monday, 
Nov. 28, 1SS1, according to State 
auditor's report, the deposits of this 
bank amounted to $10,129,258.03, 
and the number of depositors, 
25,618. According to " Staples's 
Annals," there were in Providence 
in 1S42, 21 banks, the greater 
number of which had been 
incorp'd between the years 18 18 
and 1S36. Nearly all of these 
banks are now in existence. The 
failure of the A. & W. Sprague 
Manufacturing Co., in November, 
1873, seriously crippled a number 
of local banks that held a large 
amount of the Sprague paper. 
Nov. 21, 1SS1, the resources of 
the 1 1 State banks in Providence 
were $3,386,469.57 ; and capital 
actually paid in, $2,199,035. The 
Rhode-Island Hospital Trust at 
same date had resources of $y,- 
721,132.29. 

Baptists.  The Baptists of 
Providence, as of Rhode Island 
in general, count their org'n from 



Roger Williams. They hold to 
separateness of Church and State, 
church independency, regenera- 
tion and baptism as conditions of 
church-membership, equal rights 
of church-members, and demo- 
cratic forms of church -govern- 
ment. Yet the law of fraternal 
interdependence binds all the 
churches together in conferences 
or councils, in associations, con- 
ventions, and missionary societies. 
Under the voluntary principle, a 
remarkable unity pervades the 
denomination, both in faith and 
practice. In growth the denomi- 
nation has kept pace with the 
increase of the city. Notwith- 
standing some distinctions of 
name, as Regular, General, and 
Free Will, the first being far the 
most common,  they are a sub- 
stantial unity in their religious 
life. The best evidence of the 
intelligence, activity, and benevo- 
lence of the denomination may 
be found in the style of their 
churches, in the history of the 
First Church founded by Roger 
Williams, the founding and 
growth of Brown University, the 
Mite Society, the first Protestant 
missionary society in America,  
the Warren and Providence Asso- 
ciations, the Rhode-Island Bap- 
tist State Convention, the Rhode- 
Island Baptist Education Society, 
the Rhode-Island Baptist Social 
Union, and other benevolent 
bodies. It has had its eminent 
preachers, writers, and teachers, 
such as Williams, Manning, Mes- 
ser, Wayland, Hague, Dowling, 
Granger, Sears, Caswell, Cald- 
well, Lincoln, and Robinson. In 
the pulpits to-day are such able 
men as Brown, Bixby, Farnham, 
Montague, Taylor.  F. Deui-

Baptist Education Society, 
The Rhode Island, was org. in 
1791, to aid "destitute young 
men who give evidence of piety, 
and of a call to the gospel min 
istry, in obtaining such knowledge 
as shall be thought proper to their 
sacred calling." This aid is usu- 
ally given to needy meritorious 
students of Brown University. 
The management of the Society is 
intrusted to a Board of Directors 
(eleven in number), and the funds 
for carrying on the work are 
raised by collections in the Bap- 
tist churches and from the avails 
of a small fund. R. A. Guild, 
LL.D., sec'y. 

Baptist Social Union, The 
Rhode Island, aims " to pro- 
mote a more friendly and intimate 
association among the laymen of 
the Baptist denomination." Social 
and business meetings are held 
four times a year, and an annual 
meeting on the third Monday in 
November. Membership about 
90. Alvin F. Pease, sec'y. 

Bar Club, The Providence, 
is an association of gentlemen of 
the legal profession, availing itself 
of the educational, social, and 
other advantages which a union 
of members of one profession 
secures. The club occupies no 
permanent headquarters, but as- 
sembles upon call to social or 
business meetings as the case may 
be. Its membership includes most 
of the prominent lawyers of the 
city. Its managers comprise an 
executive committee of five mem- 
bers. Lorin M. Cook, sec'y. 

Base Ball Grounds, Messer, 
nr. High St., opened in 1878, 
are considered the finest in the 
country. They are owned by the 
Providence Base Ball Asso'n, 



which holds membership in the 
National League. In 1879 the 
" Providence Nine " held the 
League championship. All Ol- 
neyville cars pass nr. the grounds, 
and when games are played cars 
run direct from Market Sq. to the 
grounds. H. B. Winship, pres't. 

Bath-houses, Public  The 
city owns two floating bath-houses 
each 55 ft. long, 33 ft. wide. 
They are provided with suitable 
dressing-rooms; and each is in 
charge of a keeper, whose duty it 
is to preserve order and to limit 
the number of bathers. The 
bathing is free ; towels are fur- 
nished, if desired, at a nominal 
rate. The houses are under the 
direction of the Committee on the 
Harbor, who assign locations for 
them, subject to the consent of 
the City Council. The houses 
in 1882 were moved, one nr. the 
Red Bridge and the other in the 
dock at the end of South Main St. 
The latter, formerly located at 
Point-st. Bridge, was, on account 
of the filthiness of the water at 
the bridge, removed to its present 
place. At this house, according 
to Joseph Higgins, the supt., the 
record of baths given in past 
years is as follows : in 1S76 it 
was 36,210; in 1S77 only 29,767; 
in 1878 it rose to 38,602 ; in 1879 
it fell to 28,751 ; in 1880 the house 
was not opened; and in 1SS1 it 
was 37,69s. The variations were 
clue largely to the differences in 
temperature in the several years. 
A movement was inaugurated 
this year to petition the city 
government to provide bathing- 
houses supplied with water from 
the city water-works.

"Bee-hive of Industry" is 
one of the familiar titles of Provi- 
dence ; so applied by reason of 
its being one of the most ex- 
tensive manufacturing cities in 
America. 

Beneficent Congregational 
Church, Broad St., nr. Chestnut 
St., was erected in 1S09 at a cost 
of $20,000, on the site of the for- 
mer edifice, dating from 1750. It 
is a large, rectangular wooden 
building, having a portico of the 
Doric order, and surmounted by 
a dome. The latter has given to 
the church the popular name of 
the " Round Top." In 1S36 im- 
provements were made at an 
expense nearly equal to the origi- 
nal cost of the building. A bell 
imported from England is still in 
use by this society. Adjoining 
the church, on Chestnut St., is a 
brick chapel used for the Sunday- 
school and week-day meeting's. 
The organ is one of' the largest 
and finest in Providence. It was 
built by Hook & Hastings of 
Boston in 1S57. 

Bible Society, The Rhode 
Island, formed nearly 70 years 
ago to circulate the Holy Scrip- 
tures, "recognizes in its constitu- 
tion the duty of giving the Bible 
to those who do not possess it." 
This is accomplished by the 
appointment of a judicious agent 
to canvass all parts of the State. 
During the 34 months' canvass 
previous to the annual meeting, 
October, 1882, 17,909 families 
were visited, and 623 destitute 
families or persons supplied with 
the whole Bible or else with the 
New Testament. The member- 
ship list includes the names of 
prominent clergymen and laymen 
of every denomination, as the 



society is non-sectarian in char- 
acter. Rev. J. P. Root, agent,

Bicycling is a favorite amuse- 
ment of the young men and 
youths of this city, notwithstand- 
ing the obstacles which the severe 
grades in many portions of the 
-uld seem' to present. There 
are numerous local clubs, such as 
the Providence Bicycle Club, the 
Hermes Club, Narragansett Club 
Centaur Club, etc. These are 
tastefully uniformed, and include 
among their members many ex- 
pert wheelmen. The Providence 
Bicycle Club is the oldest and 
chief organization. It was formed 
in July, 1879, and has 30 members 
(active and associate). It occupies 
pleasant quarters in the Rose 
Building, Custom-IIouse Street. 
The longest jaunt taken by the 
members of this club, collectively, 
has been to Boston, Mass., a dis- 
tance of 44 miles. Individual 
members have considerably ex- 
ceeded this distance. The officers 
of the Providence Bicycle Club 
are Albert G. Carpenter, pres't; 
J. A. Cross, capt. ; and W. P. An- 
thony, sec'y. 



Blackstone Canal.  In 1796 
a navigable canal was projected 
to extend from tide-water in 
Providence, along the valley of 
the Blackstone River to the north 
line of the State, and thence 
through Worcester to the Con- 
necticut River. The Massachu- 
setts Legislature refused to grant 
a charter; and the subject was 
not revived until 1S23. when re- 
newed efforts resulted in the 
incorporation of a Blackstone 
Canal Co. in 1825. Work was 
commenced at once, and a canal 



1 2 KING ' 3 1 PO CKE TBOOK OF PR O VIDENCE. 



nearly 45 miles long was built, 
with depth of 4 ft., and width at 
bottom 20 ft, at top 45 ft. Its 
cost was $750,000. Owing to 
misunderstandings and controver- 
sies rising bet. the corporation 
and the mill-owners on the Black- 
stone, and to the long and bitter 
litigations which ensued, the pro- 
ject finally failed ; and on Nov. 
9, iS4S,the last toll was collected. 
For some distance beyond the 
city limits the narrow bed of the 
Moshassuck River was made to 
serve the purpose of this canal ; 
and some of the stone locks then 
erected could until recently have 
been seen on the river. 

Blackstone Park extends 
from Butler A v. to the Seekonk 
River. It is a wooded ravine of 
much natural beauty. A brook 
flows through the park ; and in 
summer the place, though little 
improved by art, is quite attrac- 
tive. The park was presented to 
the city in 1S66 by Wm. P. 
Vaughan and Moses B. Jenkins.

Boston & Providence Rail- 
road was the second railroad 
opened out of Boston, and the 
first out of Providence. Its first 
through trains were run in 1S35, 
at a time when steam-railroads 
were in their infancy. The road 
proper, from Boston to Provi- 
dence, is 44 miles ; and the 
branches and leased lines are 23^ 
miles in length. On this road is 
run the fastest train, as by regu- 
lar schedule, between terminal 
points, in the United States. 
This train is the Shore Line Ex- 
press to New York, which leaves 
Boston at 1 p.m. and arrives in 
Providence 57 minutes later. 
This road is the favorite and 
most direct to Boston, where the 
station, erected at a cost of $Soo,- 
000, is one of the finest in the 
world. The superintendent is 
Albert A. Folsom. 

Boundaries.  Providence is 
bounded on the N. by the towns 
of N. Providence and Pawtucket; 
on the E. by the Seekonk River 
and the harbor, separating it 
from E. Providence ; on the S. 
by Narraganset Bay and the town 
of Cranston ; and on the W. by 
Cranston, Johnston, and N. Provi- 
dence. 

Bridge, The, is a popular 
designation of Great Bridge 
(which see). 

Bridges.  There are 39 pub- 
lic bridges in and around the 



14 KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 



city. These vary in style from 
the simple wooden bridge to the 
costly and ornamental structure 
of iron. Of these, the city en- 
gineer has charge and control, un- 
der the direction of the Advising 
Committee on Bridges. See Cen- 
tral Bridge, Great Bridge, Point- 
st. Bridge, Washington Bridge. 

Broad St. is a wide thorough- 
fare extending from the centre of 
the citv to the village of Pawtuxet, 
a distance of 4 1-2 miles. It is 
the direct road to the Park 
Garden and Roger Williams 
Park, and is a favorite drive, par- 
ticularly in the sleighing-season. 

Broadway, 1 3-S miles in 
length, is a tine st., 80 feet in 
width, lined for almost its entire 
length with handsome residences. 
Starting from near the centre of 
the city, and gradually rising, i: 
reaches its highest elevation near 
St. Mary's Church, at its western 
extremitv. From this point, a fine 
view of the valley of tne Woonas- 
quatucket River, of Mt. Pleasant. 
and other portions of the Tenth 
Ward, is obtained. 

Brook-st. District (east side) 
lying south of Wickenden St., 
and facing the harbor, was taken 
by the city in 1S73 ^ or c ' ie P ur " 
pose of grading and draining. 
A steep hill, whose narrow lanes 
were crowded with wretched ten- 
ements, has given place to a 
gradual slope, with streets regu- 
larly laid out and ooen to the 
healthful breezes of the bay. The 
improvements thus far have cost 
$1,200,000. 

Brownson Lyceum, The 
(Roman Catholic), 159 West- 
minster St., incorporated in 1S5S, 
has 1 library of about 1,200 vols., 



open on Wednesday and Satur- 
day evenings. This asso'n meets 
weekly for debates, and holds a 
monthly course of entertainments. 
It has a membership of bet. 100 
and 200. 

Brown University was at first 
callrd Rhode-Island College. Its 
name was later (in 1S04) changed 
to Brown University, in honor of 
Nicholas Brown, who had been its 
most munificent benefactor. The 
University property lies at the 
head of College St. (east side), oc- 
cupying extensive grounds com- 
manding fine views. It is a liber- 
ally managed Baptist institution, 
was founded at Warren in 1674, 
and removed to Providence in 
1770. Officers 22, students 275.

The college buildings stand 
upon the crest of Prospect Hill, 
in the midst of some 15 acres of 
grounds, which are well laid out, 
grass-planted, and adorned with 
magnificent elms. Hope College, 
Manning, University, Slater, and 
Rhode-Island halls, form a con- 
tinuous straight line bet. Water- 
man and George Sts., and face 
Prospect St. The enclosure in 
front of these buildings is known 
as the "front campus," and in the 
rear as the "middle campus." 
Beyond this, and in the rear of 
Sayles Memorial Hall and the 
Laboratory, is a narrower strip 
of land, sloping toward the ball- 
grounds, designated as the "back 
campus." 

Below are enumerated the build- 
ings, laboratories, libraries, etc.

grounds frequently during the 
summer term. 

Gymnasium.  The university 
greatly needs a gymnasium of its 
own. At present the students 
have access to a gymnasium-hall 
at reduced rates. 

Hope College, facing Prospect 
St., is a brick dormitory, four 
stories in height. Erected in 
1822, at the expense of the Hon. 
Nicholas Brown, and named by 
him in honor of his sister Mrs. 
Hope Ives. 

Laboratory, The Chemical, on 
the "middle campus" of the 
University grounds, is a brick 
structure, containing rooms for 
chemical experiments, and reci- 
tation-rooms. 

Library, The, Waterman St., 
cor. of Prospect, was erected 
through the munificence of John 
Carter Brown, who at his death in 
1874 bequeathed a lot and $50,000 
to supplement a previous dona- 
tion (amounting with interest to 
about $26,000) for this purpose. 
To this amount ($76,000) Mrs. 
Brown added $20,000. The 
building is in the Venetian 
Gothic style, of pressed brick with 
stone trimmings. Over the porch 
is carved an owl with book, and 
above the doorway is the seal of 
the college. The'edifice is in the 
form of a cross. In the centre is 
a reading-room, 35 ft. in diameter, 
68 ft. high. Two octagonal gal- 
leries run around this room, and 
extend into the different wings. 
In the basement is a neatly fitted- 
up room containing four her- 
baria, which comprise upwards 
of 70,000 specimens. There are 
accommodations for 150,000 vol- 
umes ; the present collection 
numbering more than 53,000, be- 
sides 17,000 unbound pamphlets. 



The building was dedicated Feb. 
16, 1S78. William R. Walker, 
architect. 

Manning Hall, bet. Hope 
College and University Hall, was 
the gift of Hon. Nicholas Brown 
in 1834. It is of stone, cement- 
covered, and is an enlarged model 
of a Grecian temple of the Doric 
order. Height, 40 ft. Divided 
into two stories, the upper of 
which is used as a chapel, the 
lower for recitation-rooms. The 
lower story contained the library 
until the new building was com- 
pleted in 1878. 

President 's House, College, cor. 
Prospect St., is a plain wooden 
edifice, with an Ionic portico. 
Built in 1840. 

Rhode-Island Hall, erected in 
1840 by subscription, stands at 
the S. end of the " front campus " 
close to George, and facing Pros- 
pect St. It is of stone, covered 
with cement, and divided into two 
lofty stories. On the lower floor 
are lecture-rooms, and in the 
upper story is a natural-history 
museum, containing about 30,000 
specimens in zoology, 10,000 in 
mineralogy, 5,000 in geology and 
palaeontology, together with a 
collection of coins and medals, 
and a number of Indian and 
other barbaric implements and 
curiosities. Recently an ell was 
added to the building, the lower 
floor of which is used for a physi- 
cal laboratory, and the upper 
story for a portrait-gallery. The 
basement is used for a zoological 
laboratory. 

Sayles Memorial Hall, on the 
"middle campus," facing Univer- 
sity Hall, is, with the exception 
of the Library, perhaps, the most 
elegant of the college buildings. 
It is the generous gift of the Hon.

William F. Sayles of Pawtucket, 
in memory of his son William F. 
Sayles who died in 1S76, while a 
member of the sophomore class. 
The building, Romanesque in 
style, is of red faced Westerly 
granite, trimmed with brown 
Longmeadow sandstone. It con- 
tains a hall and recitation-rooms. 
The hall is 107 ft. long and 55 
wide, and seats 1,100 persons, or, 
at alumni dinners, about 550 
persons. It is wainscoted in ash, 
and a trussed roof of the same 
material rises to a height of 65 ft. 
The gallery is capable of seating 
100 persons. The entire front 
of the edifice is devoted to eight 
recitation-rooms. On the band 
of stone-work between the sec- 
ond and third stories of the 
tower (94 ft. in height) is this in- 
scription : " Filio Pater Posuit 
MDCCCLXXX." A. C. Morse, 
architect. 

Slater Hall, on the " front cam- 
pus," between University and 
Rhode-Island halls, is an orna- 
mental four-story brick dormi- 
tory building, with terra-cotta 
trimmings, and a tiled roof ; and 
was erected in 1879, through the 
liberality of the Hon. Horatio N. 
Slater of Webster, Mass. 

University Hall is the central 
building of those which line the 
"front campus." It is of brick, 
cement covered, 150 ft. long, and 
is crowned by a small belfry. The 
corner-stone was laid in May, 
1770, and the building constructed 
in imitation of Nassau Hall, at 
Princeton, N. J. From Dec. 7, 
1776, until May 27, 1782, it was 
occupied for barracks and a hos- 
pital by the American and French 
troops. It is now used for dor- 
mitories, offices, and recitation- 
rooms. It shows the footsteps 



of time, especially before the 
doors and on the stairways. The 
president's and the registrar's 
offices are on the ground floor of 
this building; and a room at one 
end is occupied by a students' 
reading-room association.

Burnside Memorial, The.  
Through the efforts and liberality 
of a number of prominent gentle- 
men of the city, a fund has been 
raised towards the erection of a 
bronze statue of Gen. Ambrose E. 
Burnside, to be placed in some 
public sq. It is hoped that this 
may be sufficiently increased to 
obtain an equestrian statue. Sub- 
scriptions are received at the 
"Journal " office, 2 Weybosset St. 

Butler Exchange affords a

is in this building. 

Butler Hospital for the In- 
sane is situated on the W. bank 
of the Seekonk River, adjoining 
Swan - Point Cemetery. The 
building is a handsome brick 
structure, standing in the midst 
of 140 acres with fine pleasure- 
grounds and tillage-lands, beauti- 
fully diversified with ravines and

native woodland. The institution 
originated in a bequest of Hon. 
Nicholas Brown, who, at his 
death in 1841, bequeathed $30,000 
to establish a home for the insane. 
In 1S44 Cyrus Butler offered to 
add $40,000 to this bequest, pro- 
vided a like sum should be raised 
by subscription. This was soon 
done, and the hospital was com- 
pleted in 1S47. It is a private 
institution, supported by the re- 
ceipts for board and treatment of 
patients, and by the income of 
four funds (Permanent, Duncan 
Improvement, Donation, and Li- 
brary funds), amounting in all to 
about $84,000. The charges are 
varied according to the require- 
ments of each case, and liberal 
allowance is made for patients of 
limited means. 310 patients were 
treated in 1SS1 ; the average 
number at a time being 1S0, fill- 
ing the hospital almost constantly 
to its utmost capacity. The 
average weekly expenditure per 
patient was $8.45; the average 
weekly charge, $8.01. The most 
important improvement of the 
past year was the erection of a 
large brick barn, at an expense 
of $10,500, to increase accommo- 
dation for horses and carriages 
for the use of inmates. By the 
bequest of Dr. Isaac Ray, the 
first supt. of the hospital (died 
March 31, 1S81, at his home in 
Philadelphia, Penn.), the institu- 
tion becomes the possessor of his 
valuable collection of books, and 
is made the residuary legatee of 
his property, subject to the life 
estate of Mrs. Ray. Visitors ad- 
mitted from 9 to 12 A. M., and 
from 2 to 5 P. M., every day ex- 
cept Sunday. Amos C. Barstow, 
prest. ; John W. Sawyer, M.D., 
sup't and physician. 



Caledonian Club, The Prov- 
idence, was org. in July, 1S79, 
by a few seceding members of the 
Caledonian Society (mentioned 
below) and others. The mem- 
bership is small. 

Caledonian Society, The 
Providence, is an org. of Scotch- 
men numbering over 50 members, 
formed for the purpose of keep- 
ing alive an interest in the cus- 
toms and observances of their 
native land. Its rooms at 142 
Westminster St are opened Sat- 
urday evenings for social con- 
verse and enjoyment ; business 
meetings are held first and third 
Wednesdays in each month. 
The society hold their " Scotch 
Games " annually at Rocky Point, 
and many members of the org. 
and invited guests may then be 
seen in Highland costume. Sick 
members receive benefits of $5.00 
a week, and assessments are 
made on the death of a member 
for the benefit of his family.

Calender Street runs from 
Fountain to Mason St., and is 
named from the Prov. Dyeing, 
Bleaching, and Calendering Co. 

Calender-street Fire was a 
lamentable calamity which oc- 
curred bet. 10 and 11 o'clock 
a.m., Nov. 22, 1882, and caused 
the death of four persons and the 
serious injury of nearly a score 
of others. The fire took place 
in the Calender Building, cor. 
Calender and Mason Sts., a four- 
story brick structure owned by 
the Slater Mill and Power Co. 
It started on the third floor, in 
the workroom of " Le Jolly Dye 
House," by the ignition of naph- 
tha, then being used in cleansing 
garments ; the ignition occurring, 



1 8 KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 



it is supposed, from the portable 
stove of a plumber who was 
making repairs. In the fourth 
floor was W. H. Robinson's 
jewelry shop, where about 30 
persons, male and female, were 
employed, among whom were 
those injured or killed. The 
firemen were somehow unable to 
render aid in saving life, and the 
hero of the fire was Christian 
Timman, a German, about 40 
years old, employed as a truck- 
man. Mounting a ladder which 
reached but a -short distance 
above the top of the third-story 
windows, he supported himself 
on the topmost rounds, and, tak- 
ing hold of a telegraph-wire, he 
dexterously managed to bring two 
girls from a fourth-story window 
safely to the ground. 

Callender, McAuslan, & 
Troup occupy one of the best 
business blocks in New England, 
and carry on the largest wholesale 
and retail dry-goods business 
in this State. Their record is 
most remarkable : only sixteen 
years ago they began in this city, 
under the same name and with 
just the same partners as at 
present; but they have demon- 
strated the possibility of acquir- 
ing an honorable reputation and 
an ample fortune simply by 
means of upright dealing, indus- 
try, and thorough knowledge in 
one's calling. The three partners, 
Walter Callender, John McAus- 
lan, and John E. Troup, were 
born in Scotland ; and all have 
been engaged their whole life- 
time in this one line of business. 
By reason of their ability, and de- 
votion to their work, they set out 
on what has ever since been an 
uninterrupted success. In 1S66 



they began in Low's Building, 
then standing on Westminster 
St. ; but in about seven years they 
had outgrown their premises, and 
had accumulated the means of 
building for themselves their pres- 
ent attractive new block, expressly 
constructed for their business, on 
Westminster St., on the site of 
the once familiar brick stone-lined 
First Universalist Church with 
its unique wooden steeple. At 
first their new building was large 
enough to accommodate them on 
the first two floors, while the 
upper part was rented for offices 
and other uses. But the business 
constantly developed, and gradu- 
ally all the other occupants made 
way for the requirements of the 
firm. And even then, only four 
years after the building was 
erected, an addition had to be 
made of about the same dimen- 
sions as the original building. A 
short time afterward an addition 
was made for offices and sample- 
rooms. And now the firm occupy 
solely for their business the whole 
structure familiar to every one 
who ever visited Providence. It 
is a splendid specimen of mercan- 
tile architecture, and was designed 
by Gen. William R. Walker. 
The main building is 96 by 60 
feet, practically five stories high; 
and the addition is about the 
same dimensions, three stories 
high, giving a total floor surface 
of nearly 50,000 sq. ft. The 
rooms are exceedingly lofty, well 
lighted, and admirably ventilated. 
Every convenience is provided for 
conducting this extensive busi- 
ness, which consists of the innum- 
erable lines of goods which are to 
be found in the modern wholesale 
and retail dry-goods establish- 
ment. Early in the career of the

firm, the people of Providence 
and vicinity gained the impression 
that the pa'rtners were from Bos- 
ton, and consequently spoke of 
the establishment as the "Boston 
Store," a name which the firm 
was compelled to adopt, and the 
people have always adhered to. 
There are nearly 250 persons m 
the employ of the firm ; and they 
appear to be better paid, and bet- 
ter satisfied with their work, than 
are the employees of most estab- 
lishments in the same and 
kindred lines of trade. The 
members of the firm, too, in spite 
of their rapid success, have never 
lost sight of their obligations as 
members of society, and citizens 
of this country ; all of them hav- 
ing early and constantly been 
identified with various social, lit- 
erary, religious, political, and 
other associations for the benefit 
of some part of the community. 

Camp Street, at the N. end 
of the city, takes its name from 
the old camp-ground occupied by 
the French soldiers in 1798, nr. 
what is now the cor. of Camp 
and North Sts. Traces of the 
excavations are still visible. 

Canal.  See Blackstone 
Canal. 

Canal Street extends from 
Market Sq. to Smith St., and is 
chiefly occupied by wholesale and 
retail dealers in groceries, meats, 
and produce. The southern end 
of the street was established Feb. 
19, 1792, under the name of 
North Water St.; but until 1814 
it extended only to Steeple St. 
From that time until 1S25, the 
warehouse lots north of Steeple 
St. were gradually filled in ; and 
in January, 1825, the street was 
opened as a public highway to its 



present extent. The Blackstone 
Canal Co. widened the street 
shortly afterwards, and then it 
received its present name. The 
canal ran along the west side 
of the street, where a portion of 
the walled-up banks may yet be 
seen. 

Canonchet, known also as Nan- 
untenoo or Quananshett, a noted 
chieftain of the Narragansetts, 
of whom he was the last sachem. 
He espoused the cause of King 
Philip, and was incessantly and 
bitterly hostile to the settlers. 
He could not be persuaded to 
surrender, or to betray his tribe. 
Irving said of him, "The last 
scene of his life is one of the 
noblest instances on record of 
Indian magnanimity." When he 
was condemned to die, he said, 
" I like it well : I shall die before 
my heart is soft, or I have said 
any thing unworthy of myself." 

Canonicus [1565-1647]- the 
eldest of four sons of Tashtas- 
suck, the first of the recorded 
chiefs of the Narragansett tribe 
of Indians. He lived on Conan- 
icut Island, and was a warm 
friend of Roger Williams, to 
whom he made the grant of the 
" Providence Plantations." He 
maintained friendly and peaceful 
relations with the early settlers. 

Carpenter's Gold and Sil- 
ver refining, assaying, and 
Sweep -smelting Works is a 
representative establishment of a 
leading industry in Providence. 
In a three-story brick building at 
Nos. 29 and 31 Page St., the in- 
teresting processes of refining and 
assaying gold and silver are car- 
ried on the year round. The 
smelting of " sweeps " seems a 
peculiar business, but neverthe- 



KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 



less it is an important one. Mr. 
Carpenter alone, for instance, 
works over every day about a ton 
of seeming rubbish, which has 
been swept up or gathered from 
establishments using gold or sil- 
ver in any form. These "sweep- 
ings " are made by jewellers in 
filing and polishing jewelry ; 
binders, in gilding edges and 
covers of books ; frame-makers, 
in making frames ; photogra- 
phers, in printing photographs ; 
gold-beaters, in hammering gold- 
leaf ; dentists, in filling teeth ; 
platers, in plating table-ware, 
cutlery, etc. Out of this seeming 
rubbish, by grinding, sifting, heat- 
ing, and various other processes, 
is obtained whatever precious 
metal, however small the quan- 
tity, it contains ; and this usually 
amounts to considerable in value, 
although the product is but a 
minute particle of the quantity 
worked over. This smelting is 
done usually on a percentage of 
the value of the product ; and the 
establishments which send their 
sweepings here are not only those 
in the city, but hundreds of firms 
scattered throughout the United 
States and British America. 
Horace F. Carpenter, the pro- 
prietor of the works, is an old 
reside.it of Providence, and a 
scientific-school graduate, in the 
class of 1S60, of Brown Univer- 
sity, where he ranked high as a 
chemist. For upwards of 20 
years he has devoted himself to 
this business, and for the past 10 
years has been sole proprietor of 
these works. 

Casino, The, Brook St., cor. 
Manning St., is a frame building, 
with an iron-covered hip roof, 
just completed for the Providence 
Tennis Club, a society which em- 



braces a number of wealthy citi- 
zens. It comprises a main build- 
ing and three wings. The build- 
ing proper is about 45 ft. high, 
with a concreted floor 95 ft. sq., 
divided into two "tennis-courts." 
One wing contains a bowling- 
alley, the second is an archery- 
court, the other furnishes a spec- 
tators' gallery for the tennis-hal). 
Cathedral of SS. Peter and 
Paul, High St., cor. Fenner. 
This magnificent edifice, the cor- 
ner-stone of which was laid with 
all the pomp and ceremony of 
the Romish Church, Nov. 28, 
1S7S, will require at least two 
years more for its completion. It 
is on the site of a church of the 
same name, is in the Gothic style, 
cruciform, with nave, transept, 
and clerestory, and is constructed 
of red Longmeadow stone, rough- 
faced. The total length of the 
building is 170 ft. ; width at the 
transept, 122 ft. The nave is 50 
ft. wide and 74 ft. high ; the side 
aisles are each 10 ft. wide. There 
are two towers in front, each 156 
ft. high, eventually to be crowned 
by spires. The interior space of 
the cathedral is unbroken except 
by the two rows of white marble 
clustered columns which support 
the clerestory. The vaulted roof 
is of oak, stained and polished. 
Over the front entrance is the 
organ gallery. There are four 
large rose-windows, one at either 
end of nave and transept : these, 
as well as the smaller windows, 
are as yet without decoration, 
but it is the intention to fill them 
with richly stained glass. P. C. 
Keely of Brooklyn is the build- 
ing architect, T. E. Read of New 
York contractor ; A. G. Macom- 
ber of Providence furnished the 
mason-work of the exterior, and

Catholics.  This city is in the 
diocese of Providence, which, in 
1S72, was set off from that of 
Hartford, and which embraces 
the State of Rhode Island, and 
that part of Massachusetts com- 
prised within Bristol, Barnstable, 
and part of Plymouth Counties,

than 200. They first worshipped 
in Mechanics' Hall, and for sev- 
eral years afterward in the " Old 
Town House." SS. Peter and 
Paul Church was erected in 1837. 
Rt. Rev. T. F. Hendricken was 
consecrated first bishop of Prov- 
idence in April 2S, 1S72. In the 
city are 1 1 churches, 2 chapels, 7

in the rear of the Friends' School 
grounds, at the head of Tabor 
Av. It is a picturesque spot, and,

by reason of certain varieties of 
wild flowers found here, is a 
favorite resort of botanists. In 
cold weather, part of the swamp 
is frozen sufficiently smooth to 
permit skating on its surface. 

Cecilia Society, org. 1S79. 
Under its auspices, a course of 
chamber-concerts is given during 
the winter at Amateur Dramatic 
Hall. It has only 100 members, 
each paying $10 a year, which 
entitles the subscriber to four 
tickets for every concert. The 
limited membership gives a semi- 
private character to the entertain- 
ments. 

Cemeteries and Burial- 
Grounds.

on the Seekonk River, bet. the 
Butler Hospital grounds and 
Riverside Cemetery. It is a 
beautiful spot, containing about 
200 acres of land, tastefully laid 
out and adorned with shrubbery, 
flower-beds, fountains, etc. There 
are many elegant and costly mon- 
uments within the enclosure, no- 
ticeably those belonging to the 
Abell, Barnaby, Hillings, Nightin- 
gale, Sayles, and Sprague estates. 
The remains of Gen. Burnside

Visitors admitted daily, including 
Sundays. Governor-st. H. c, and 
connecting coach. 

West Burial-Ground, cor. Plane 
and Beacon Sts., is no longer a

years since into house-lots, while 
the remainder has been left in a 
neglected and disgraceful condi- 
tion. 

Besides these, there are numer- 
ous small private burial-grounds, 
within or near the city limits. 

Central Baptist Church, 
The, society was organized in 
1805. A church building was 
erected on Pine St. in 1S07, which 
was destroyed Sept. 23, 181 5 ; but 
a new edifice was immediately 
erected. The present church edi- 
fice, at the junc. of Broad and 
High Sts., was completed in 1857, 
at a cost of about $65,000. Ex- 
tensive alterations in the church 
building were made in 1S82. The 
organ was enlarged, and trans- 
ferred from a gallery over the 
vestibule to a corresponding gal- 
lery at the rear of the church and 
just behind the pulpit platform. 
New seats in an amphitheatri- 
cal form were put into the main 
auditorium, extensive improve- 



ments made in the lecture-room, 
and the whole building generally 
renovated. Members, 500. The 
pastor is Richard Montague. 

Central Bridge, or "Red 
Bridge " as it is belter known from 
its color, crosses the Seekonk 
River, connecting Providence with 
E. Providence. It is an iron 
bridge, 390 ft. in length, con- 
structed in 1872, with a draw 
operated by hand - power. It 
supersedes a plain wooden struc- 
ture, also painted red, which 
stood here for many years. Dis- 
tance from Market Square, 1 1-2 
miles. 

Central Cong. Church, Bene- 
fit nr. College St., is a large brick 
edifice, with an imposing free- 
stone front surmounted by two

velt organ of three manuals of 58 
notes each and a pedal of 27 
notes, 51 stops, and 2,374 pipes 
(with spaces for 116 more) was 
dedicated to the uses of the so- 
ciety April 4, 1882. 

Charitable Fuel Society, 
The Providence, assists worthy 
persons who are temporarily in 
want. It has been in existence 
over 50 years, and distributes an- 
nually between $4,000 and $5,000 
worth of fuel to those who need 
its aid. Robert B. Chambers, 
sec'y. 

Charity Building, 3 N. Court 
St., is a plain wooden structure, 
where temporary relief is fur- 
nished to the destitute. Only

Chestnut-st. M. E. Church, 
erected in 1S22, cor. Clifford and 
Chestnut Sts., is the oldest of its 
denomination in the city. The 
first house of the society stood on

gestive name applied to the com- 
bination of three short and narrow 
lanes, leading from S. Main to 
S. Water St., nr. Transit St. It 
is crowded with old and dilapi- 
dated tenement-houses. 

Children's Friend Society. 
See Children's Home. 

Children's Home, Tobey St., 
was built in 1863, under the aus- 
pices of the Prov. Children's 
Friend Soc, which was org. in 
1S35, through the efforts of the 



late Harriet Ware " to provide 
for the support and education of 
indigent children, not otherwise 
provided for, and who for want of 
parental care are in a suffering or 
dangerous condition." Since its 
formation, 1,300 children have re- 
ceived its care. For several years 
the " Home " was at the cor. of 
Broad and Stewart Sts. The pres- 
ent spacious and comfortable 
brick building has 64 inmates, 
while 39 children under the charge 
of the society are placed out in 
families. The institution is sup- 
ported by contributions from the 
various churches, and by the in- 
come derived from investment of 
legacies, bequests, and donations. 

Chimes, Grace Church. The 
only set of chimes in the city is 
that belonging to Grace Church, 
Westminster, cor. Mathewson St. 
These bells, 16 in number, were 
hung March 30, 1861, and played 
for the first time on the following 
day, Easter Sunday. They were 
donated by various individuals 
and corporations, whose names 
they bear, including two military 
organizations : the First Light In- 
fantry and the Marine Corps of 
Artillery. The Infantry bell was 
given with the condition that the 
chimes should always be rung on 
Sept. 10, the anniversary of the 
battle of Lake Erie, or " Perry's 
Victory." The bells are also 
rung on all national holidays. 

Christian Associations. See

Churches. There are 77 
church edifices in Providence, and 
nearly 90 societies meeting for 
religious worship. The follow- 
ing is a complete list of the 
churches and their pastors,

Churchill Memorial Fund 
was established in 1881, under the 
auspices of the Rhode-Island 
Women's Club, which desired 
to testify by some enduring 
memorial its sorrow for the loss 
of Mrs. Elizabeth K. Churchill, 
who died March 7, 1SS1, and its 
grateful appreciation, not only of 
her enthusiastic devotion to the 
interests of the Club, but of her 
entire life-work, which was an 
unceasing effort to right wrongs, 
and help on in every way the 
truest welfare of others. The 
income of the Fund is expended 
in the interest of the working- 
women of Providence, under the 
direction of the officers of the 
R. I. Women's Club, and thus far 
has been appropriated for a 
course of lectures to women of 
this class, a work started in 1SS0 
by Mrs. Churchill. These lec- 
tures, for which a nominal fee is 
asked, consist of practical talks 
on the various concerns of daily 
life, and cannot fail to be of use 
to those who lack proper training 
for the accomplishment of every- 
day duties and for prompt action 
in sudden emergencies. 

Cincinnati, Rhode - Island 
Society of, org. in 1783 and 
chartered in 1814, was formed to 
preserve in some permanent form 
a record of those early patriots 
who were engaged in the struggle 
for American independence. The 
society was composed of 71 origi- 
nal members, chiefly army officers, 



whose descendants inherited the 
right of membership. A portion 
of the hereditary members, about 
25, met in December, 1S77, and 
org. with the purpose of imbuing 
new life and vigor into the so- 
ciety. Sec'y, Henry E. Turner,

City Building (old), Market 
Sq., built, by lottery, for a mar- 
ket-house in 1773. Third story 
added by St. John's Lodge (Ma- 
sonic) in 1797. The building was 
gradually absorbed for municipal 
purposes, and afforded cramped 
accommodation for the various 
city offices until their removal to 
the new City Hall in 1878. The 
building is leased for a term of 
ten years from Jan. i, 1S80, to the 
Board of Trade.

has, in the course of time, under- 
gone some modifications. It will 
be noticed that the "raised cir- 
cle " now contains in the upper 
half thereof the words " Seal of 
the city of Providence " and in 
the lower half thereof the words, 
"Founded 1636" and "Incorpo- 
rated 1832." This arrangement 
of the words does away with the 
"narrower circle" spoken of. 
The central device has also been 
somewhat altered, and now repre- 
sents the canoe containing Roger 
Williams as arrived at Slate Rock, 
upon which are grouped the In- 
dians in friendly attitudes.

Clam-Bakes.  These essen- 
tially Rhode-Island institutions 
may be patronized at most of the 
shore resorts along the bay. The 
bake is usually made in primitive 
fashion on a rude floor of stones, 
previously heated by a wood fire 
built upon it. A thin layer of 
seaweed is put upon the heated 
stones ; then the clams are piled 
up, and spread with another thin 
layer of seaweed. The whole is 
then covered with canvas to re- 
tain the heat and steam. Green 
corn, potatoes, and other vegeta- 
bles, together with fried clams, 
fish, lobster, and watermelon, are 
furnished as accessories to the 
clam dinner, the uniform price of 
which is 50 cts. 

Cleansing is one of the most 
important departments of Le- 
wando's French Dye House, 270 
Westminster St. The process 
employed by this house is the in- 
vention of M. Jolly of Paris ; and 
Lewando, it is said, " has the 
whole field of New England to 
himself." It was introduced here 
by Lewando, and is carried on at 
the present time by two French- 
men who served under Jolly 
in Paris. It is known as the 
dry process, and by its means 
all the most delicate fabrics, 
laces, feathers, silks, etc., can be 
cleansed without injury to the 
texture or colors. 

Clothing is in the present state 
of civilization one of the requisites 
of human comfort and one of the 
chief adornments of mankind. 
And clothing, ready-made or 
made to order, can be obtained 
nowhere in the world to better 
advantage than at the establish- 
ment of Macullar, Parker, & Com- 
pany, 112 Westminster St. A

Cotton Manufacture.  The 
earliest attempt to manufacture 
cotton in Providence was about 
the year 1788. Daniel Anthony, 
Andrew Dexter, and Lewis Peck 
formed a partnership to make 
"homespun cloth;" and from an 
English model obtained in Bever- 
ly, Mass., they constructed a 
spinning-jenny, " which was first 
set up in a private house, and 
afterwards removed to the mar- 
ket-house chamber in Providence, 



and operated there." Soon after 
they constructed a carding-ma- 
chine and a spinning-frame, and 
also had a loom built under the 
direction of Joseph Alexander, a 
native of Scotland. All this ma- 
chinery was crude, and did not 
work well. The spinning-frame 
was removed to Pawtucket, and 
operated by water-power, and 
soon after was sold to Moses 
Brown of Providence. William 
Almy and Smith Brown, under 
the patronage of Moses Brown, 
with this machine and others they 
had purchased from various 
parties, carried on the manufac- 
ture in Pawtucket ; but, owing to 
the clumsiness of the machinery, 
found it unprofitable. In 1790, 
when affairs were in this condition, 
a young Englishman named Sam- 
uel Slater, who was skilled in the 
cotton manufacture, and had then 
been but a few months in the 
country, was engaged by Moses 
Brown to come to Pawtucket. 
Slater found the machines of 
Almy & Brown too imperfect to 
work satisfactorily, so he pro- 
ceeded to construct machines 
after the English models. Hav- 
ing no plans or drawings, he had 
to rely entirely on his memory ; 
yet after much labor and many 
discouragements he finally suc- 
ceeded. This was the first thor- 
oughly successful attempt to 
manufacture cotton in America 
with the machines invented by 
ArkwrightandHargreaves. Almy, 
Brown,"& Slater formed a partner- 
ship, and carried on their business 
at Pawtucket for many years, and 
also built factories on other avail- 
able sites in the neighborhood. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the 
manufacture was begun in Paw- 
tucket, Providence has reaped 



3 2 



KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 



the greatest benefit from it. Prov- 
idence was the natural centre of 
operations, andbecame the market 
where the buying and selling, the 
making and importing of supplies 
for the factories, were conducted. 
To this fact, more than any other, 
is due the growth of the city. 
Under the direction of Slater and 
his partners, and the men they 
had trained, many factories were 
built on all the streams centring 
at Providence, and mills were 
also built in adjoining districts, 
in Massachusetts and Connecti- 
cut. In 1S11 there were 17 cotton- 
mills in Providence and vicinity, 
and 5 in course of construction ; 
and in adjoining towns in Rhode 
Island there were 8, and 5 being 
erected. In 1S12, within a radius 
of 30 miles from Providence there 
were 53 factories,  33 in Rhode 
Island, and 20 in Massachusetts. 
Since then the business has con- 
stantly increased in amount. The 
offices of many companies operat- 
ing mills in Connecticut, Massa- 
chusetts, and elsewhere, are located 
in Providence. In i860, 77 cotton- 
mills located outside the city lim- 
its were owned in Providence. 
The chief mills within the city lim- 
its are: Providence Steam Mill, 
established by Samuel Slater and 
others in 1S27 ; Oriental Mills, 
Admiral cor. Whipple St. ; Elm- 
wood Cotton Mills, Mawney St.; 
the factories of B. B. & R. Knight 
on Carpenter St. and Broad St.; 
and the factories of the Fletcher 
Manuf. Co., Charles St. (See arti- 
cle on Manufactures.)

Court House of Providence 
County, Benefit, cor. College St., 
is an imposing structure of Dan- 
vers face-brick, with Connecticut 
brown-stone trimmings, and an 
underpinning of Quincy granite. 
The building, begun in June, 1875, 
was dedicated Dec. 18, 1S77. Its 
style is based upon the French 
Gothic order of architecture. 
There is much artistic carving 
noticeable, particularly upon the 
corbel of the oriel window on 
College St., facing Market Sq., 
and around the capitals of the 
polished granite columns at the 
porches. Above the main en- 
trance rises a tower 200 ft. in 
height, whichcontains a fine clock. 
The interior of the building is 
handsomely fitted up, and com- 
prises rooms for the common 
pleas and supreme courts, offices 
of the judges, clerks of the courts, 
and other county officers, waiting- 
rooms, and other apartments. On 
the second floor is a law-library, 
ceiled throughout, and capable of 
accommodating 50,000 vols. The

cost of the building was about 
$225,000, and with land and fur- 
niture $175,000 more. Stone & 
Carpenter, architects. 

Cove, The, is an elliptical basin, 
about a mile in circumference, 
lying in the geographical centre 
of the city. It was formerly an 
irregular body of water, navigable 
for vessels of considerable ton- 
nage ; but from time to time its 
area has been reduced by filling 
in the surrounding low lands. Its 
sides are built up with stone, and 
finished by an iron fence. The 
basin is fed by two small mill- 
streams, the Woonasquatucket 
and Moshassuck Rivers ; and the 
Providence River flows outward to 
the south. Mud accumulates here 
very rapidly, owing to the refuse 
flowing down from the mills, and to 
sewers which empty here. Dredg- 
ing has been attempted at great 
expense, and with unsatisfactory 
results ; and propositions for con- 
verting the Cove and surrounding 
lands wholly to railroad pur- 
poses are under discussion. 

Cove Lands, The, are large 
tracts of territory, lying N. and 
N.-W. of the Cove basin, which 
were formerly flowed by tide- 
water. Most of this has been 
filled in for railroad and building 
purposes, but quite an area of 
marshy lowlands still remains. 
The city's right to these lands was 
purchased from the State in 1875, 
at a cost of $200,000. 

Cove Promenade, The, en- 
circles the Cove, and has a gen- 
eral width of So ft. It is adorned 
by fine shade-trees, provided with 
comfortable seats, and in the 
evening is well-lighted by numer- 
ous gas-lamps ; but the effluvia 
rising from the Cove at low tide, 



and its proximity to the railroads, 
render it an unpopular place of 
resort. 

Custom Clothing, or "mer- 
chant-tailoring," is one of the chief 
departments of Macullar, Par- 
ker, & Company's establishment, 
which is described in its alpha- 
betical place. 

Custom House, The, Wcv- 
bosset, cor. Custom-House St., is 
a fine granite structure, three 
stories in height, opened in 1857. 
It cost about $225,000. Here 
upon the upper floors may be 
found the Internal-Revenue Office, 
the United-States Court Room, 
and rooms for the judges and 
other government officials. The 
lower story is devoted to the uses 
of the Post-Office Department. 
This department re-arranged and 
refurnished its quarters in 1S80, 
putting in at that time, among 
other improvements, over 1,500 
brass letter-boxes, secured by 
Yale locks.

object is "to create a more frater- 
nal intercourse, to facilitate the

mote the progress of the theory 
and practice of the dental pro- 
fession. Any respectable prac- 
tising dentist, above the age of 
21 years, may become a member 
of the association. The society's 
library contains the latest dental 
works and reviews. Dr. A. W.

Design, Rhode-Island School 
of, 2S3 Westminster St. (Hoppin 
Homestead Bl'd'g), promotes the 
advancement of art-education by 
instructing artisans and students 
in drawing, painting, designing, 
modelling, etc., at cost. Lecture 
and art exhibitions are given. 
Instruction in art-needlework is 
also furnished. About 195 stu- 
dents attend its day and evening 
sessions. Open from October to 
May. E. Rose, principal. 

Dexter Asylum, Hope St., tes- 
tifies to the generosity of the late 
Ebenezer Knight Dexter, who, 
at his decease in 1824, left about 
40 acres of land and $60,000, to 
establish a home for the poor of 
Providence. The  building, of 
painted brick with granite base- 
ment, consists of a main building 
five stories high, and two wings 
each three stories in height. Be- 
side the necessary rooms for in- 
mates, sup't and family, and for 
reception-rooms, it contains a 
chapel in the third story. The 
well-cultivated lands, which fur- 
nish fine vegetables for the city 
market, aresurrounded by a stone 
wall, 8 ft. high, and 3 ft. thick at 
the base,  according to the con- 
ditions of the bequest. On the 
Hope-st. side, the wall within a 
few years has been lowered, and 
finished by a capping of granite. 
The institution, apparently admi- 
rably conducted, accommodates 
over a hundred inmates. John 
M. Knowles, sup't. 



Dexter Donation, The, com- 
prises the Dexter Training- 
Ground, the land on which the 
Dexter Asylum now stands, and 
other property, real and personal, 
devised to the town in 1S24 by 
Ebenezer Knight Dexter, for the 
support and maintenance of the 
poor. 

Dexter Training-Ground, a 
part of the " Dexter Donation,'' 
was reserved and appropriated 
by the will of Ebenezer Knight 
Dexter, for a training-ground. 
It is a grassy enclosure of about 
91-12 acres, west of Dexter St., 
near High St., and is now seldom 
used for military purposes. 

Dispensaries. 

Homceopathic Dispensary, rear of 
307 Westminster St., furnishes 
gratuitous medical advice from 
1 1 A. M. to I i'. M., daily, and 
surgical advice once a week at 
the same hours. When medicine 
is furnished, a small charge is 
made. A dental department for 
poor people is also maintained in 
connection with this charity. 

Providence Dispensary, The, fur- 
nishes medical advice and medi- 
cines free of charge to parties 
supplied by subscribers with tick- 
ets. J. B. Branch, sec'y, 20 Mar-

Dodge's Boston Dye-House, 
established many years ago, and 
familiar to all Providence people, 
was succeeded a few years since 
by the Lewando's French Dye- 
House, which has its office at 270 
Westminster St., adjoining Music 
Hall. 

"Dorr's Hill," or "Dorr's

Sts. It is so steep as to be im- 
passable for vehicles, rising as it 
does 20 1-7 ft. in each 100 ft.; its 
summit at Congdon St. is 164 ft. 
above high-water mark. 

Drinking-Fountain, on An- 
gell St., nr. Brown, was a gift to 
the city by Frank E. Richmond. 

Drinking - Fountains.  For 
whatever it may possess in the 
way of ornamental and artistic 
drinking-fountains, the city is in- 
debted to the generosity of pri- 
vate individuals. A few pumps 
are still standing in the older por- 
tions of the city, relics of a past 
generation ; and, since the intro- 
duction of Pawtuxet water, fau- 
cets have been attached to vari- 
ous lamp-posts centrally located; 
while, for the convenience of 
horses, iron drinking-troughs of 
excellent construction have been 
distributed throughout the city. 
See Athenaeum Drinking-Foun- 
tain, Dalrymple Drinking-Foun- 
tain, and Drinking-Fountain. 

Dyeing, with the most perfect 
results in all the various branches, 
is done by the long-established 
Lewando's French Dye -House, 
office 270 Westminster St. No 
one not familiar with the large 
works at Watertown, Mass., can 
form any idea of the innumerable 
sizes, shapes, and uses of the arti- 
cles which are cleansed and dyed 
there. The process peculiar to 
the house obviates all necessity 
of taking to pieces the garments, 
which was formerly done at great 
cost and oftentimes with serious 
damage. The dyeing of all goods 
that can be dyed by modern pro- 
cesses is done in the most accept- 
able manner by the Lewando 
Dye-House. 



Dyerville, chiefly a manufac- 
turing village, belonged formerly 
to the town of North Providence, 
but now forms a part of the Tenth 
Ward. 

East Side is a name applied 
to the territory lying E. of the 
Prov. and Moshassuck Rivers. 
It rises abruptly from the river, 
in some places to a height of 200 
ft. Brown University, Dexter Asy- 
lum, Hope Reservoir, Friends' 
School, Prospect Terrace, Butler 
Hospital, Swan-Point and North 
cemeteries, and many elegant 
private residences, are in this dis- 
trict. It is the oldest portion of 
the city. Area, 3 sq. miles. 

Elevators for People.  The 
introduction of vertical railways 
in buildings has already gained 
such a foothold in this and all 
other cities that few people realize 
how recently they were introduced. 
It is only ten years ago since the 
first passenger-elevator was made 
use of in Providence. This was 
in the Wheaton& Anthony Build- 
ing, at No. 65 Westminster St. 
This was soon followed by one in 
the Woods Building, cor. of Col- 
lege and Main Sts. Both were 
built by the Whittier Machine Co. 
of Boston, who have since built 
many fine elevators for noteworthy 
buildings throughout the United 
States. In Providence, among the 
buildings in which are elevators 
made by the Whittier Co., are 
the Vaughan Building, Callender, 
McAuslan, & Troup, Equitable 
Insurance Co., Dyer-street Block, 
Daniels Building, and Woods 
Building.

sessions at its rooms, 21 Weybos- 
set. It is a secret benevolent 
organization. Its membership 
exceeds 100, and is confined 
chiefly to actors and friends of 
the theatrical profession, in com- 
mon with lodges of this order in 
other cities. 

Elmhurst. See Female Acad- 
emy of the Sacred Heart. 

Elmwood is the local name of 
that part of the Ninth Ward W. 
of Broad St. This district, in the 
southern part of the city, was re- 
ceived from Cranston in 1S68. 
The building formerly used as 
the Cranston town-clerk's office 
is still standing at the cor. of 
Potter's Av. and Greenwich St. 
Elmwood contains many hand- 
some residences, several large 
ice-ponds, Adelaide Grove, and 
Roger Williams Park. 

Employment Society, The 
Providence, was formed in 1837, 
chartered in 1S50, to furnish em- 
ployment to indigent needle- 
women at a fair compensation. 
Sewing-schools were established 
by its efforts, and were continued 
until within a few years. Orders 
for all kinds of needlework are 
taken at the rooms, 238 West- 
minster St. 

Engineers' Association of 
Rhode Island, org. in Decem- 
ber, 1879, anc l incorporated in 
1S81, was established with a view 
to protect the interests of compe- 
tent engineers, and has for its aim 
"the better security and protec- 
tion to life and property in the 
management and handling of 
steam boilers and engines." The 
society discountenances strikes 
in toto. It has 90 members, mem- 
bership being limited to stationary 



and marine engineers ; and only 
persons thoroughly competent in 
their profession are admitted into 
the association. These pay a 
monthly fee of 50 cts. The 
society possesses a well-selected 
library Of mechanical and scien- 
tific works, and holds weekly 
meetings at 41 Westminster St.

Equitable Fire and Marine 
Insurance Co. is the second 
largest joint-stock f.re and marine 
insurance co. in Rhode Island; 
the largest being the Providence 
Washington, noticed elsewhere. 
Although the Equitable is the 
youngest, it is one of the most 
prosperous, of the joint-stock 
co.'s. It was org. in 1S60, the 
president being the Hon. Thomas 
G. Turner, who had been governor 
of the State the preceding year. 
The stockholders were chiefly the 
personal friends of the president 
and the first secretary, Augustus 
M. Turner. The original capital 
was $100,000; and this was in- 
creased first in 1S64 to $200,000; 
again in 1S72 to $300,000. In the 
latter year occurred the great Bos- 
ton fire, which involved the Equi- 
table in a loss of $305,000, although 
its assets were only $345,000. This 
was a severe test of the strength 
and integrity of the Co. ; but the 
result was in every way creditable, 
every loss being unequivocally 
met and promptly paid in full. 
From that time its progress has 
been almost uninterrupted; its

gross assets on Jan. I, 1SS2, 

amounting to $46.5,051 ; \yhile its 
gross liabilities, excluding its capi- 
tal, were only $86,549, and its net 
surplus was $81,511. The Co. 
owns its own building, known as 
the Equitab e Building, on the cor. 
of Custom-House and Weybosset 
Sts. It is an attractive and well- 
constructed iron-front structure, 
wholly occupied by offices on the 
various floors, all of which are 
made readily accessible by a 
Whittier passenger-elevator. The 
building, besides being an orna- 
ment to the city, and providing 
commodious and conveniently situ- 
ated offices for the Co., proves to 
be also a good investment. Mr. 
Turner was president for 15 years, 
until his death in 1875. His suc- 
cessor was Frederick W. Arnold, 
who had previously been the sec- 
retary for 14 years, having suc- 
ceeded Mr. Turner about a year 
after the Co. was organized. Mr. 
Arnold has therefore been con- 
nected with the Co. upwards of 
21 years. The sec'y is James E. 
Tillinghast, who was elected in 
1875, after eight years' service in 
the employ of the Equitable. 

Exchange Place, a broad 
sq. (900 ft. long), extends from 
Washington Row to Uorrance St. 
At the W. end stand the City 
Hall and Soldiers' Monument. 
The Union R. R. Depot fills the 
N.side. Opposite are the Butler 
Exchange, and many wholesale 
houses. Engine-Station No. 1 
faces the City Hall. Many mil- 
itary and other reviews are held 
in this place. 

Excursions.  During the 
summer season ample opportu- 
nities are afforded for visiting 
the various shore resorts and 



other attractive localities in and 
about the city. Excellent steam- 
ers ply at frequent intervals up 
and down the bay, stopping at 
all important points. Several of 
these are reached by railroads, 
which issue excursion-tickets. En- 
joyable trips to nearerpoints of in- 
terest in the suburbs may be taken 
in the open horse-cars. Newport 
and Block Island are within 2 and 
4 hours' sail, respectively, from 
the city. A ride by rail of a little 
more than an hour brings one to 
Narragansett Pier, which is also 
reached by steamer from New- 
port. Mt. Hope, the ancient seat 
of the famous Indian chief, King 
Philip, may be visited by the 
boats of the Fall River Steam- 
boat Co. Rocky Point, with its 
mammoth dining-hall for shore 
dinners, lofty tower, summer 
theatre, groves, and other attrac- 
tions, is distant but an hour from 
the city. Other noticeable shore 
resorts are Oakland Beach, But- 
tonwood, Bullock's Point, River- 
side, Silver Spring, Ocean Cot- 
tage, and Field's Point, the last 
mentioned elsewhere.

Farmer & Co., E. G., success- 
ors to Farmer, Livermore, & Co., 
are the only steel-engravers in 
Rhode Island, and one of the few 
firms in this line whose customers 
extend throughout the United 
States. They have been estab- 
lished four years, and have al- 
ready earned a reputation for 
executing the highest grades of 
steel-engraving. The senior part- 
ner, E. G. Farmer, jun., has been 
in this same business for 12 years, 
having been connected at various 
times with the American and Con- 
tinental Bank-Note Companies 
of New York, and with John A. 
Lowell & Co. of Boston. The 
premises of E. G. Farmer & Co. 
include the third floor of the Rose 
Building, a fine brick structure 
with granite trimmings, situated at 
No. 18 Custom-house St., directly 
opposite the Custom House. The 
equipment of the establishment 
embraces all the machinery and 
appliances requisite for executing 
all varieties of steel-engraving for 
corporations, societies, firms, and 
individuals. Bonds, certificates of 
stock, stationery, wedding and 
social invitations, business and 
personal cards, circulars, etc., 
comprise part of the regular work 



constantly doing; while elabo- 
rate engraving for programmes, 
menus, and special occasions, is 
promptly and exquisitely exe- 
cuted. Steel-engraving has be- 
come recognized as one of the fine 
arts ; and, in order to compete 
successfully with all firms, E. G. 
Farmer & Co. constantly em- 
ploy noted and artistic designers, 
and experienced and skilled en- 
gravers, use the best materials, 
and put the finest finish on all 
their work.

Field's Point, 3 miles from 
Great Bridge, came into posses- 
sion of the town in 1S25, and in 
186S became a part of Ward IX. 
It comprises a farm of 37 acres, 
occupied by the sentinel for a 
quarantine-station and by the 
small-pox hospital. The latter, a 
white cottage on a bluff overlook- 
ing the water, has received but 
two patients in the last nine years. 
Most of the farm is leased as a 
shore resort, where shore dinners 
are served daily during the excur- 



Fire-Alarm Telegraph, The. 
 The system in use is what 
is known as "Gamewell's Auto- 
matic." It was introduced in 
December, 1S70, at which time 
50 boxes were placed in different 
parts of the city, communicating 
electrically with the various alarm 
bells and gongs. The number of 
boxes has increased from year to 
year, until now there are about 
"120. The general directions for 
holders of keys (who invariably 
reside in the vicinity of the box) 
are as follows :  

1. Go to the nearest box, open 
the door, pull the hook clown as 
far as you can (firmly, without 
jerking)', and then let it slide 
back ; close the door, and remove 
the key. 

2. If, upon going to a box to 
give an alarm, you hear the small 
bell inside ringing (which is an 
indication that an alarm is being 
sent over the wires) in all such 
cases count the signals being 
sounded, and be certain whether 
it is for the same fire or not ; if 
not for the same fire, wait until 
the signals have entirely ceased 
before pulling the box. 

Kev-ho'ders are cautioned :  

1. To give no alarm until the 
fire is certain. 

2. To give no alarm for fire 
seen at a distance. 

3. To be sure, after giving an 
alarm, that the door is securely 
closed before the box is left. 

Three strokes sounded by the 
alarm-bells indicate the tire is out, 
and the department dismissed. 
One stroke is sounded by the 
alarm-bells at 12 M., and at 8.30 
i>. m. See heading Time. 

Fire-Department, The, is as

in the country. Since its organi- 
zation as a paid department in 
1854, there has been but one con- 
flagration of any size in the city 
(in 1S77, loss $450,000). It num- 
bers 152 men (74 permanent, 7S 
" call-men ") under the control of 
the chief engineer, and four as- 
sistant engineers. It consists of 
15 hose-carts, 4 hook-and-ladder 
trucks, beside 8 steam fire-engines 
rarely used, as the force and supply 
of the water at the 1,161 hydrants, 
distributed throughout the city, 
are sufficient to subdue any ordi- 
nary fire. A valuable auxiliary is 
the Protective Department, main- 
tained by the insurance-compa- 
nies, to lessen the damage from 
water as well as fire. A fire- 
marshal, an office created in 1881, 
is empowered to examine into the 
causes of all fires in which valu- 
able property has been destroyed 
or damaged. In 1SS1 there were 
184 alarms, with losses aggregat- 
ing only $74,000, and with insur- 
ance of about $260,000. For the 
financial year 18S2-S3, $100,000 
have been appropriated, or $5,000 
more than in 1S81-S2.

First Baptist Church, in a lot 
1 1-6 acres in extent, N. Main, 
cor. Waterman St., is of wood, 
and was erected in 1775. I ts 
handsome spire is 196 ft. high. 
The society, founded in 1638-39, 
chartered in 1774, claims to be 
the oldest Baptist organization in 
America. The organ, built by 
Hook & Hastings in 1833, was the 
gift of Hon. Nicholas Brown, a 
benefactor of Brown University. 
The church has been used ever 
since its completion for holding 



the commencement exercises of 
Brown University. 

First Congregational Church 
(Unitarian), The, Benefit, cor. 
Benevolent St., is one of the most 
noticeable churches in the city, 
owing to its prominent position 
and graceful steeple. A tablet 
on the front of the church indi- 
cates that the present edifice was 
built in 1S16, on the site of a 
previous one destroyed by fire 
in 1 8 14. Within the church the 
high, old-fashioned mahogany 
pulpit still remains, on each side 
of which are marble tablets 
erected to the memory of the 
Rev. Dr. Hitchcock and the Rev. 
Dr. Hall, former pastors of this 
society. A handsome granite 
chapel stands in the rear of the 
church. It contains a Sunday- 
school room, parlors, and other 
rooms for the use of the society. 

First Roman-Catholic Priest 
regularly settled in this city was 
Robert D. Woodlcy, who was 
sent here in 1827 by Benedict 
Fenwick, the Catholic Bishop of 
New England. He conducted 
the services in Mechanics' Hall 
for about 3 years, and was then 
succeeded by John Corry. 

First Settlers of Providence, 
besides Roger Williams, were, 
Wm. Harris, John Smith, Joshua 
Verrin, Thos. Angell, and Francis 
Wickes. 

First Steamboat that ever 
sailed on Providence River was 
an invention of Elisha Ormsbee 
of Providence in 1792. After a 
few trials it was abandoned.

taste in the interior arrangement, 
and lighted by large, finely stained 
windows. Two meeting-houses 
belonging to this society have 
been erected on Westminster, 
cor. Union St. : the first was de- 
stroyed by fire in 1S25; the sec- 
ond was sold in 1S70, and its site 
is occupied by the " Boston Store."

Florence is a name familiar to 
Providence people by reason of 
the extensive advertising and gen- 
eral popularity of the Florence 
brands of knitting, etching, and 
filling silks made by the Nono- 
tuck Silk Co., whose mills are 
in the villages of Florence and 
Leeds, in the town of Northamp- 
ton, Mass. These silks are sold 
by leading dealers everywhere, 
and are recognized by the trade 
as equal to any silks made any- 
where in the world. The New- 
nd agent is Geo. D. Atkins, 
18 Summer St., Boston. 

Foresters, Ancient Order of, 
is an org'n having weekly sick-

Franklin Lyceum, 62 West- 
minster St., was formed in 1831, 
and incorp'd in 1843 as a debat- 
ing and literary society, and 
adopted its present name in the 
following year. In 1848 the 
Westminster Lyceum,' a newly 
formed society, merged its sep- 
arate title and existence in the 
Franklin Lyceum. Nov. 19, 1858, 
formal possession was taken of 
the rooms now occupied. These 
comprise a reading-room and a 
library of about 7,600 vols., and a 
hall where the Monday-evening 
debates are held. For nearly 
forty years the Lyceum has sus- 
tained a public course of lectures 
and other entertainments during 
the winter. It was unsuccessful 
in its lecture-course last season, 
and, to avoid heavy loss, gave it 
up after one or two entertain- 
ments. A debt which had en- 
cumbered the society was lifted a 
year or two ago by Frederic A. 
Gower, formerly the gen. agent 
of the Bell Telephone Co. For 
several years past the library has 
not received many additions, but 
just now special efforts are being 
made to secure a decided increase 
in the number of books. The 
Lyceum has served a most useful 
purpose in fitting young men for 
public life, its discipline in par- 
liamentary practice alone being of 
sufficient value to enlist many 
young men in its membership. It 
is a well-known fact, that most of 
Rhode Island's prominent men in 
the past half-century are included 
in its list of members. Member- 
ship 500.

Franklin Society, The Prov- 
idence, holds public meetings 
every alternate Tuesday at its 
rooms, 54 N. Main St. It was 
incorporated in 1S23. It aims to 
cultivate and disseminate scien- 
tific knowledge by means of 
lectures and discussions. It has 
a cabinet of natural history, min- 
eralogical and geological speci- 
mens, and a small valuable scien- 
tific library. C. M. Salisbury,

Franklin Square, Atwell's 
Ave., cor. Bradford St., is a dim- 
inutive piece of ground, conveyed 
to the town in 1808, by Amos M. 
Atwell and others, "for some 
public purpose or purposes." It 
serves as a small breathing space 
for the denizens of that part of 
the city. 

French Camp.  See Camp 
Street. 

French Dye-House is a name 
used by many concerns in this 
country ; but the one in New 
England to which it most legit- 
imately belongs is Lewando's 
French Dye-House, established 
forty years ago in Boston by 
A. Lewando, a native Parisian. 
The works of this concern are in 
Watertown, Mass. The main 
office is at 17 Temple Place, 
Boston ; and the Providence 
branch is at 270 Westminster St., 
adjoining Music Hall. 

French Memorial, The.  
This monument, the result of the 
unremitting exertions of the Rev. 
Frederic Denison, assisted by 
liberal-minded citizens, has been 
erected in the North Burial 
Ground, over the graves of the 
French soldiers who died on 
Rhode-Island soil during the Rev- 
olution. It is of Westerly granite, 



consisting of a base stone 8 x 4 f t. 
and a ledger stone 6x2 ft. and 2 
ft. high. The latter bears on its 
upper surface a French shield, and 
on the east side are cut the words : 
" Our French Allies in the Revo- 
lution ; " on the west, " La Grati- 
tude de Rhode Island." The 
north end panel is inscribed, 
"Tribute of the People. Dec- 
orated by the French Delegation, 
Nov. 1, 1881." The south end 
has a Revolutionary cartridge- 
box in relief, with the date 17S2. 
The monument was dedicated 
July 4, 1SS2. A procession com- 
posed of the First Light Infantry 
Regiment, R. I. M. ; Bon Lafay- 
ette Guard of New York ; Soci- 
ete Gardes Lafayette ; French 
Consul General and French Le- 
gation; French Colony of Prov- 
idence, militia, bands, and invited 
guests,  marched through the 
sts. of the city to the North Burial- 
Ground. The monument was 
there unveiled with appropriate 
ceremonies in the presence of 
the assembled multitude. Rev. 
Frederic Denison delivered an 
oration ; addresses were made by 
the Hon. T. A. Doyle, Mayor Hay- 
ward, M Le Faivre, the French 
Consul-General ; and Prof. J. E. 
Guilbert read a poem in the 
French language. The introduc- 
tory prayer and the benediction 
were offered by Bishop Clark. 

French Visitors who attended 
the Yorktown celebration enjoyed 
the hospitality of this city Nov. 1, 
1SS1, visited the old French camp- 
ing grounds, the graves of the 
French soldiers in the North Buri- 
al-Ground, Brown University, and 
other points of interest. 

Friends' Boarding-School is

richly endowed educational insti- 
tutions in New England. Its 225 
pupils come from twenty States, 
to prepare in a literary and scien- 
tific or classical course (or a com- 
bination of the two) for mercan- 
tile life or for universities and 
professional schools. Its founder, 
Brown, was also a founder 
of Brown University. He gave, 
besides his personal care, nearly 
$20,000, and about 50 acres of 
land which are now worth per- 
haps $500,000. I lis son, Obadiah 
Brown, gave $ioo,coo, and since 
then benefactors in large and 
small sums have been numerous 
in all parts of the country ; among 
them Wm. Almv, Ebenezer Met- 
calf, $30,000, and a Boston lady 
who in 1S82 gave $30,000. The 
school has been able by its am- 
ple endowment to do noble 
work. Its foundation might be 
dated 17S0, when Moses Brown 
headed a subscription by means 
of which the Society of Friends 
in 17S4 began a school at Ports- 
mouth, R.I. ; but it dates merely 
from 18 1 9, since which time the 
school has been almost uninter- 
ruptedly conducted at Providence. 
The grounds, buildings, and 
equipment should be seen by 
every visitor to the city. The 
property is cor. Hope and Lloyd 
Sts., about a mile from the City 
Hall. The 50 acres are upon an 
eminence 1S2 ft. above tide- 
water, and overlook the city, the 
rivers, and Narragansett Pay. 
Nearly all the towns in Rhode 
Island can be seen from the 
cupola on the main building. The 
main building is of brick, 220 ft. 
long, and contains a dining-hall, 
girls' schoolroom, public recep- 
tion-room, parlors and nurseries, 
recitation-rooms, and dormitories. 



An extension of brick, 76 ft. long, 
contains a boys' schoolroom and 
dormitories. "Alumni Hall," a 
three-story brick structure, 126 ft. 
long, contains on the first floor a 
grand public hall, besides rooms 
for the scientific apparatus and 
cabinets, the library, and reading- 
room ; and on the upper floors 
dormitories for girls. There are 
also two gymnasiums,  one for 
each sex,  an enclosed place for 
roller-skating, ponds for bathing 
and skating, and academic groves 
of venerable trees for recreation 
and retreat. The equipment com- 
prises an abundance of approved 
astronomical and other scientific 
apparatus, laboratories, art- 
models, a library of 6,000 volumes, 
six pianos, and other musical 
instruments, etc. Ventilation, 
drainage, and other sanatory pre- 
cautions, are perceptible every- 
where. The school takes only 
boarding pupils, and thus becomes 
the home of about 225 boys and 
girls; and here may well be 
studied the co-education system. 
The institution is owned by the 
New-England Yearly Meeting of 
Friends, who choose the "school 
committee " of 33 men and wo- 
men. The faculty consists of 18 
male and female instructors, 
librarians, etc., eight of whom 
are college graduates, and all of 
whom are chosen by reason of 
superior qualifications. The 
principal is Augustine Jones, 
A.M., who in 1851 graduated 
from this school, and later from 
Bowdoin College, and afterwards 
from the Harvard Law School, 
and who was the partner and ex- 
ecutor of Gov. John A. Andrew, 
the Massachusetts " War Govern- 
or." He practised law in Massa- 
chusetts for 12 years, and served

in the general court for one year, 
and in 1S79 relinquished his prac- 
tice to accept his present respon- 
sible position, and has brought to 
the institution its greatest pros- 
perity. It is not possible in this 
limited space to give the details 
of the workings, terms, etc., of the 
school, but a descriptive pamphlet 
can be had free by any applicant. 
It must be stated, however, that 25 
worthy pupils receive (in scholar- 
ships) their entire board, rooms, tu- 
ition, washing, etc., free of charge; 
a fact which in itself indicates the 
character of the institution. Al- 
though managed by Friends, the 
school is wholly unsectarian, and 
one-half the pupils are of other 
denominations. Brcok-st. H. C. 

Friends, The Society of.  
This denomination, 1 which in the 
last half of the 17th century suf- 
fered the severest persecution 
from the Massachusetts and Plym- 
outh colonies, always found an 
asylum and protection in Rhode 
Island. Mary Dyer, who has the 
distinction of being the only wo- 
man who suffered capital punish- 
ment in the persecutions of 
Friends, the world over, was a 
citizen of Rhode Island, the wife 
of Wm. Dyer, the first sec'y of 
Aquidneck. In the year 1672 
George Fox, the founder of the 
sect, held a meeting in a great 
barn in Providence, which was 
thronged with people. This 
meeting is believed to have been 
the cause of the famous challenge 
sent by Roger Williams to George 
Fox, but not received, to debate in 
public 14 propositions from the

doctrines of Friends. The home 
and freedom which they found 
induced large numbers to settle 
here, until they were in numbers 
second only to the Baptists. They 
had sometimes, indeed, a control- 
ling influence in the colony, and 
several of theirmemberswere gov- 
ernors: notable among them were 
Nicholas Easton, Wm. Codding- 
ton, John Wanton, and Stephen 
HQpkins. Hopkins was expelled 
from the Society because he would 
not liberate his only slave, in 1773, 
but a short time before he signed 
the Declaration of Independence. 
Nathanael Greene, the second 
general of the Revolution, was 
from these non-resistant Friends. 
The first manufacture of pure 
cotton fabrics in this country was 
undertaken through the capital 
and influence of Moses Brown, a 
Friend, by introducing the Ark- 
wright machinery. This Society 
has now only two places of wor- 
ship in the city: (1) cor. N. Main 
and Meeting Sts., and (2) at the 
Friends' Boarding-School. The 
first-named, a plain and unpre- 
tentious wooden structure, has 
been a place of worship of the 
Society since about 1727. An 
addition was made to the building 
1111784-85. The town was accus- 
tomed, for a long time, to hold 
their meetings in this house, and 
a school was for many years kept 
in the upper part of it. A small 
Friends' meeting-house was built 
as early as 1704. The spirit of 
the age does not seem to favor 
the simple ways of Friends of the 
olden time, and they are decreas- 
ing in the old New-England com- 
munities. But in the West and 
in many other parts of the world 
they are adopting the methods of 
the world and of other churches,

Gas- Company, The Provi- 
dence, rear of \\ hat Cheer Build- 
ing, Market Sq., was chartered 
in 1847, and began the distribu- 
tion of gas in 1849. Its works on 
Pike St. (East Side) have been 
abandoned; and Langley St.( West 
Side), and the south station at 
foot of Public St., supply gas to 
thirteen holders in various sections 
of the city. In the past year 300,- 
000,000 cu. ft. of gas were made at 
the two works, about 40,000,000 
of which were supplied to the city 
street-lights and to the City Hall. 

Gas-Holders, The, generally 
called elsewhere "gasometers," 
erected by the Providence Gas 
Co., are covered with substantial 
brick buildings ; the roofs of the 
last having tinned domes. Gas- 
holder No. 10, on Crary St., is 
of immense size ; its total height 
from curbing of street to top of 
spire being 201 ft. 10 in., and 
its cupola 34 5-6 ft. high. Di- 
ameter of dome (outside), 136 ft. 
Diameter of holder, 121 ft. 6 in. 
It will be seen that this dome is 
almost as large as that of St. 
Peter's Church in Rome, which 
has a diameter of 139 ft. inside, 
and 148 ft. outside. 

Gaspee, The, was a cruiser, 
commanded by Duddington, who 
insulted and abused the Rhode- 
Island colonists. In 1772, boats 
came off from Providence in the 
night, manned by colonists who 
burned the hated cruiser, and 
wounded the offending command- 



Gazette and Country Jour- 
nal, The Providence, was the 
second newspaper founded in 



Rhode Island, and the first in 
Providence. Its founder was 
Wm. Goddard ; and "among its 
first contributors was Gov. Hop- 
kins, who began for it his 'Ac- 
count of Providence,' but called 
to other subjects by the excite- 
ment of the times he never went 
beyond the first chapter. Enough, 
however, was published to call 
out several insulting letters from 
Massachusetts."  G. IV. Greene's 
History of Rhode Island. 

It was Wm. Goddard who, 
when Franklin was removed from 
the office of sup't of the Ameri- 
can post-office, conceived the idea 
of a colonial post-office, and 
visited all the colonies to secure 
their co-operation for this pur- 
pose. 

General Assembly, The, or 
State Legislature, holds an annual 
session, commencing on the last 
Tuesday in May, at Newport,

a senator ex-officio, and 36 sena- 
tors, one from each town in the 
State, and 72 representatives,

Geneva, a manufacturing vil- 
lage just within the limits of the 
city, was formerly, before its an- 
nexation as a part of the Tenth 
Ward, in the town of North Prov- 
idence. 

Geology of the Region near 
Providence.  The geological 
structure of the region near Prov- 
idence is too complicated to be 
treated in any sufficient way in 
this volume. The following 
points have been selected as the 
most important to those who de- 
sire to get an idea of the physical 
conditions of the city as far as 
they are affected by the structure 
of the rocks in its neighborhood. 
The mainland of Rhode Island, 
lying between the western shore 
of Narragansett Bay and the 
Connecticut line, is mainly com- 
posed of very ancient rocks be- 
longing to the Laurentian and 
Lower Cambrian series. The 
mainland to the eastward of the 
Bay, in the townships of Taunton 
and Little Compton, is underlaid 
by the same series. These an- 
cient rocks afford building mate- 
rials, sienites and limestones, iron 
and copper ores. These ores 
have been the objects of some 
unprofitable mining. The iron is 
found in considerable quantities 
in the township of Cumberland, 
it is a magnetic oxide, containing 
large amounts of titanium, which 
makes it so hard to smelt that it 
has never been much used. Cop- 
per is found in small quantities 
in Cumberland, but it is in quan- 
tities too small for profitable 
working. During the Revolution- 
ary war and until after the war 
of 18 12-15, these iron ores were 
used in providing cannon and shot : 
since that time they have fallen 
into disuse. The limestones of 



Smithfield have been consider- 
ably used for making lime : the 
only hinderance to their extensive 
employment is the high price of 
fuel. The greater part of the 
water area of Narragansett Bay 
and of the surface of the most 
of its islands, as well as a part of 
the mainland beneath and near 
Providence, is occupied by rocks 
belonging to the coal measures. 
This set of rocks lies in a broad 
trough, which extends from the 
southern part of Newport to 
within about 30 miles of Boston, 
Mass. This series of rocks is 
over 7,000 feet thick, and owes 
its preservation to the fact that 
the beds were folded into a deep 
mountain valley or synclinal 
fold, so that the action of the 
sea and of glaciers could not 
wear them completely away. The 
deep and extensive inlets of Nar- 
ragansett Bay are cut out in them, 
they being much softer and more 
easily worn away than the older 
rocks of the mainland. A num- 
ber of coals are known to exist 
in these coal measures, which 
have been searched for in various 
mines, the most important of 
which were on the northern part 
of Aquidneck Island, at Crans- 
ton, and at Valley Falls. Al- 
though the coal is of the same 
age as the beds of anthracite in 
Pennsylvania, it differs from 
them in some important respects. 
It has been more changed by 
pressure and heat, so that it is 
sometimes more like graphite or 
plumbago than ordinary anthra- 
cite ; it does not ignite readily, 
though when fired it makes an 
intense heat ; where it has been 
mined it is found to be much dis- 
turbed in its position, so that 
mining work is difficult and on

Great Bridge, known also as 
Weybosset Bridge, is remarkable 
only for its width, 160 ft. It con- 
nects Market Sq. with Westmin- 
ster St. The station of the Union

Gregory's Book, Stationery, 
and Job-Printing Establish- 
ment is one of the local places of 
business well worth visiting, as 
it contains a good assortment of 
rare, valuable, and modern books 
in all departments of literature, 
including law, medicine, mechan- 
ics, theology, education, and ro- 
mance. Reference-books, such as 
encyclopaedias, dictionaries, and 
atlases, are here to be seen in 
many editions of various promi- 
nent publishers. In the stock, it is 
intended to keep every thing in 
book-form, from the " Franklin- 
Sq. Library " to the " Encyclo- 
paedia Britannica," and to keep it 
all in a manner which offers 
ready access for examination by 
patrons. The stock is chiefly 
new books, but a specialty is also 
made of buying and selling sec- 
ond-hand books of every kind. 
A large business is done in 
supplying Sunday-school libra- 
ries with complete outfits ; this 
being the Rhode Island Episco- 
pal Book Depository. This is 
also the agency of the Providence 



Lithograph Co., whose designs 
are used for Sunday-school work 
in the International Lessons. 
The stationery department sup- 
plies such goods as are usually 
found in stationery-stores, includ- 
ing albums, pocket-books, gold, 
steel, and stylographic pens, etc. 
Cards and stationery are engraved 
or printed for weddings, balls, 
parties, visiting, and other pur- 
poses. The business was estab- 
lished under the firm name of 
Gregory & White, by Harry Greg- 
ory, the present proprietor, and 
Col. Hunter C. White, who with- 
drew in 1SS2. Mr. Gregory has 
been in the book-business in 
Providence for the past sixteen 
years, and has established himself 
as a leading bookseller in this 
State.

miles. From shore to shore it 
measures from a quarter to three- 
quarters of a mile ; bet. the " har-

1 -2 mile. Two railroad coal-piers 
over 1,000 ft. long, project from 
either shore. "Green-Jacket"

Harris - Corliss Engine 
Works is one of the many 
local industries which have given 
to Providence its pre-eminence as 
a manufacturing city ; the engine 
made here being now in use by 
great manufacturing establish- 
ments in almost every State in 
the Union. The works are ex- 
tremely neat in appearance, and 
are situated on Promenade St., at 
the cor. of Park St., about 6 min. 
walk W. of the Union Depot. 
Employment is given here to up- 
wards of 300 hands ; and the 
machinery and appliances in use 
are surpassed by few works of its 
class in the world. The chief 
specialty is the making of steam- 
engines of any size from 10 to 
1,000 horse-power. It is impos- 
sible in this limited space to give 
a description of the various shops 
or to give an idea of the many 
advantages of the Harris-Corliss

engine ; but a catalogue giving 
views of the engine, and embody- 
ing enthusiastic testimonials from 
leading firms using the engines, is 
sent free on application. It is 
well known that the engine has 
achieved an international reputa- 
tion, and performs its work with 
the greatest economy. A writer 
has said, "The Hairis-Corliss 
engine is not of mushroom 
growth, nor has its perfection 
been the labor of a day ; and to 
Mr. Harris belongs the credit of 
having advanced the standard of 
excellence of the representative 
automatic cut-off engine. Imbued 
with the true spirit of progress, 
he has retained all that was 
superior in the Corliss engine, 
and by his fertile resources rec- 
tified every known defect, and as 
a result produced an engine that 
has no successful rival." The 
inventor and sole manufacturer 
of the Harris-Corliss engine is 
Wm. A. Harris, who has lived in 
Providence for the past 36 years, 
and has been engaged in this in- 
dustry for nearly 27 years.

Health of Providence, The. 
 Providence, as shown by the 
death-rate in proportion to pop- 
ulation, is a remarkably healthy 
city. Estimating the number of 
inhabitants to be 112,000, the 
mortality of 18S1 was in the pro- 
portion of 19.12 per thousand, or 
one in every 52.21 inhabitants. 
This, as compared with other 
large cities where accurate rec- 
ords are kept, is considerably 
better than the average. 



 High School, The, a massive 
brick building, with stone trim- 
mings, of much architectural beau- 
ty, cor. of Summer and Pond Sts., 
cost with the land about $200,000, 
and was dedicated in 187S. There 
are nine schoolrooms in use, with 
accommodations for 630 pupils. 
Three rooms, accommodating 270 
pupils, are in reserve. A hall in 
the third story, 64 by 108 ft., will 
seat about 1,400 persons. William 
R. Walker, architect.

Home for Aged Men, 64 
Point St., established in 1874, 
occupies a building with accom- 
modation for but twelve, the 
present number of inmates. It is 
supported chiefly by yearly sub- 
scriptions and donations. It has 
a building-fund, and a lot of land 
on Elmwood Av., donated by 
the late Joseph J. Cooke under 
certain conditions, upon which it 
hopes to erect a " Home " at an 
early date. The inmates must be 
indigent men of American birth, 
of correct habits, at least 60 years 
of age, residents of the city for 
10 years next preceding their ap- 
plication for admission, and for 
whom the sum of $125 has been 
paid. Visitors admitted daily, 
except Sunday. Eddy-st. H. c. 

Home for Aged Women, 
Tockwotton St., opp. State Re-

situation, overlooking the harbor 
and bay. It was founded in 1856, 
and received inmates in a build- 
ing formerly standing upon the 
site of the present handsome brick 
edifice, which was completed in 
November, 1S64. It is supported

mainly by donations, collections, 
and from the income of an in- 
vested fund. Inmates are re- 
ceived upon conditions similar to 
those imposed by the Home for 
Aged Men, except that the en- 
trance-fee is $150, and the mini-

Homceopathic Hospital.  
A fund of $9,000 or $10,000 for the 
erection of a hospital in some 
part of the city, where patients 
may receive homoeopathic treat- 
ment, has been raised through the 
efforts of the Ladies' Homoeo- 
pathic Aid Asso'n, org'd in 1S74. 
A very successful State Festival, 
the proceeds of which were, add- 
ed to the fund, was given by 
this ass'n in January last. The 
ladies, aided by the Rhode-Island 
Homceopathic Society, also main- 
tain a Homceopathic Dispensary. 

Hope Club, incorporated in 
1S76, occupies a handsomely fur- 
nished and well-situated house at 
292 Benefit St. It is a purely 
social organization of a some- 
what exclusive character, and in- 
cludes among its members, about 
125 in number, prominent manu- 
facturers, bankers, lawyers, and 
other influential citizens. The in- 
itiation-fee is $100, annual dues 
$50. Visitors admitted only on 
invitation of members. 

Hope Reservoir (E. side), 
bounded by Thayer,01ney, Brown, 
and Barnes Sts., covers an area 
of nearly eighteen acres, and has a 
capacity of some 75,000,000 gals. 
On Olney St. is the high-service 
engine-house, a fine modern 
Gothic brick edifice, containing 



two engines,  a Corliss engine, 
and one designed by A. F. Nagle, 
and built by the Prov. Engine Co., 
with a pumping capacity of about 
5,000,000 gals, a day each. Broad 
(lights of steps lead to a paved 
walk upon the embankment ex- 
tending around the reservoir. 
The path is made safe by rail- 
ings, and affords a delightful view.

Hotels.  From the opening 
of the simple tavern in Olney's 
Lane, kept by Joseph Olney, to 
the completion of the luxurious 
Narragansett Hotel, kept by

more than kept abreast of other 
improvements. It is not the 
province of this work to furnish 
the history of the hotels which 
have had their day : all that can 
be done is to enumerate the more 
prominent hotels of the present 
time, and then describe the most 
magnificent hotel  the Narra-

Institute o f Instruction, 
Rhode-Island, was org. in 1845, 
to promote " the improvement of 
public schools and other means of 
popular education." The annual 
session, occurring in January and 
lasting several days, takes place 
in Providence. The meetings, 
most of which are open to all 
friends of education, are held 
at different public schools, and 
 for a number of years past  
at Music Hall. Papers are read 
and addresses made on subjects 
relating to both the educational 
and moral advancement of pupils, 
and opportunity is given for dis-

poor needle-women, who come 
weekly to the rooms to receive 
work, chiefly sewing of the plainer 
sort. The institution receives its 
support from annual subscriptions 
and from funds raised by occa- 
sional entertainments. 

Jews.  After the Spanish 
and Portuguese Jews were driven 
out of Newport by the British 
army in the Revolution, a few of 
them came to Providence, but 
not enough to organize a syna- 
gogue. Within the past 50 years 
there have appeared a number 
of Hebrews from Central and 
Northern Europe. These Ger- 
man, Russian, and Polish Jews 
have at last become quite a fac- 
tor in the life of the city. The 
Russian, Polish, and some Ger- 
man Jews claim to be Orthodox. 
The others, mainly Germans, are 
Reformed. 

The Orthodox orgd. in 1S75, 
under the name of " Sons of 
Zion." They began to worship 
on Canal St. ; removed for a 
time to Wayland Building on 
N. Main St., but now hold ser- 
vice at No. 42 Canal St. 
Their first reader was the Rev. 
Lazarus Finsilwer. They hold 
the old forms of ritual : prayers 
in Hebrew alone ; discourses in 
German ; heads covered ; faces 
in worship towards Jerusalem ; 
women apart from the men. The 
common congregation counts 
about 40. 

The Reformed orgd. in 1877, 
under the name of " Sons of 
Israel." Their first rabbi was 
the Rev. Dr. Jacob Voorsanger. 
He was followed by the Revs. 
M. Moses and M. Rottenburg. 
Myer Noot is now serving as a 
reader. They located at first on 
the cor. Pine and Page Sts. In 



Oct. 1SS2, they established their 
synagogue at 9S YVeybosset St. 
They take greater freedom than 
the Orthodox ; have prayers 
both in Hebrew and German ; 
discourses in English ; men and 
women sit together ; thus they 
are more progressive and more 
in harmony with the spirit of the 
times : but they worship with 
their faces toward Jerusalem. 

The Jewish cemetery on Res- 
ervoir Av. was first opened in 
1857, but was fully dedicated in 
the present year (1SS2). Two 
Jewish societies are mentioned 
in this book under heading " Ger- 
man Secret Societies."  Fred- 
eric Denison. 

Kindergarten, A free, was 
opened in May, 1SS1, at the old 
Fountain-st. Grammar School, nr. 
Aborn St. Starting with two pu- 
pils, the number has increased 
to forty, who receive thorough 
instruction from two competent 
teachers  one giving her services 
 under the supervision of Mrs. 
C. M. N. Alden, whose private 
kindergarten on Angell St. has 
long been known and appreciated. 
The charity is supported by sub- 
scription. 

King Ferdinand II. of the 
Two Sicilies, a bust of, stands at 
the Broad-st. entrance of Roger 
Williams Park. This piece of 
sculpture, executed in Europe, is 
of white marble, resting on a 
granite pedestal, and was pre- 
sented to the city in 1SS1. 

Knights and Ladies of Hon- 
or is an organization similar to 
the Knights of Honor, with which 
it was connected until Jan. 1, 
18S2. The first Lodge in Rhode 
Island was started in Providence, 
Jan. 4, 1877. It admits to mem-

bership ladies and gentlemen. It 
provides for two grades of co- 
operative life insurance, one be- 
ing for $1,000 and the other for 
$2,000. 

Knights of Honor began in 
Providence, Nov. 5, 1S75, by the 
organizing of the "Providence 
Lodge," No. 1S2, with 17 charter 
members. Its membership now 
is about 200. It meets in Pres- 
cott Post Hall. There are now 
two other lodges: the "Excelsior," 
org. April 30, 1877, which meets 
in Reform Club Hall, 41 West- 
minster St.; and the "Golden 
Rule," org. July 23, 1877, which 
meets in Prescott Post Hall. 1 he 
Knights of Honor is a secret or- 
ganization which provides weekly 
benefits to its sick members, and 
an insurance of $2,000 to the 1 
family of a deceased member. It | 
is a national organization, having 
at time of last report 138,000 
members in the United States. 

Knights of Pythias. There 
are six lodges of this society in 
the city, numbering some 400 
members. It is a secret, benevo- 
lent order, paying from $3.00 to 
$5.00 a week to its sick and dis- 
abled members. Connected with 
it are two beneficial associations, 
participation in the advantages of 
which is optional ; the first, K. of 
P. Sick Benefit, secures an ad- 
ditional allowance of $7.00 a 
week; the second, an Endowment 
Rank, offers an insurance upon 
the life of its members varying 
from $1,000 to $4,000. G. K. of 
R. and S., Wm. A. Wilson. 

Knitting-Silk is probably used 
in every well-regulated family m 
Providence ; and it may be inter- 
esting to know that Geo. D. 
Atkins of Boston, the New-Eng- 



land agent of the Nonotuck Silk 
Co , will mail prepaid to any 
address, without charge, a neat 
and useful pamphlet, entitled 
"How to use Florence Knitting 
Silk." The pamphlet gives many 
illustrations and tested instruc- 
tions on the best manner of using 
knitting-silks. 

Ladies' Sanatory Gymna- 
sium, fifth floor Butler Ex- 
change, was opened in December, 
1 881, by Dr. J. P. Brooks, to pro- 
mote a healthful use of gymnastic 
exercise among ladies and chil- 
dren. The complete apparatus 
was selected by Dr. D. A. Sar- 
gent, Prof, of Physical Training 
at Harvard University. The ex- 
ercise for each individual is care- 
fully prescribed, and over-exer- 
l tion prevented. 

I La Salle Academy, for boys, 
119 Fountain St., is conducted by 
Ithe Roman Catholic order of 
Christian Brothers, and was 
founded in 1872. The building 
occupied is a large three-story 
brick edifice. The school is es- 
sentially Roman Catholic ; has 
no primary department, and is 
free to the boys of the parish 
(SS. Peter and Paul) who are 
qualified to enter. Average at- 
tendance about 180.

Latter- Day Saints, The 
re-organized Church of Jesus 
Christ, formed in this city in 
1S69, have had no regular house 
of worship until recently, when 
they hired and furnished Carroll 
Hall, 2S1 High St., in which they 
first held services Sunday, Sept. 
24, 1882. The denomination to

I a total membership of 30,000.

They believe in the Bible as the 
word of God, and also think that 
the Book of Mormon as revealed 
to Joseph Smith is inspired. 
They do not hold to nor believe 
in the doctrine of polygamy as 
practised by the Mormons of 
Utah, and their organization is 
distinct from Utah Mormonism. 
The denomination dates from 
1S59, and claims to be the his- 
toric successor of the original 
Mormon Church, as the term " re- 
organized " indicates. This claim 
has been recognized by the Unit- 
ed States Courts. The present 
headquarters of the body is La- 
moille, Decatur Co., Io.; and 
the organization is chartered 
under the laws of Illinois. Mem- 
bership of the Providence church 
is about 200.

Lewando's French Dye- 
House was established about 40 
years ago by Lewando, a French- 
man who had been instructed in 
the best schools of his native 
country. His reputation as a 
practical dyer and cleanser of all 
grades of fabrics has never been 
surpassed by any one in this 
country. The business that he 
set in operation by establishing a 
dye-house at Watertown, Mass., 
has steadily developed, until to- 
day it is one of the largest and 
best known in its line ; the works 
giving constant employment to 
over 100 persons. The main 
office has always been in Boston, 
but regular branch offices have 
been established from time to 
time in various cities. In 1SS0 
one was established at Provi- 
dence, R. I., which is also the 
successor of Dodge's Boston Dye- 



House. The Providence branch 

is at 270 Westminster St., next 
building below Music Hall. 

Libraries.  The important 
public libraries are those of 
Brown University, the Provi- 
dence Athena?um, the Providence 
Public Library, the Rhode Island 
Historical Society, the Young 
Men's Christian Association, the 
Union for Christian Work, and 
the Franklin Lyceum,  all of 
which are noticed more in detail 
elsewhere in this book, in their 
alphabetical places. The Rhode 
Island Medical Society. 54 Noith 
Main St., has 2,000 medical books. 
The aggregate number of volumes 
in libraries open to the public or 
shareholders exceeds 17 5, ceo. 

There are many valuable pri- 
vate libraries, each having its 
specialty. Probably the most 
noteworthy is that of John Carter 
Brown, containing over 10,000 
volumes, and being very rich in 
early Americana. Other notable 
libraries are those of John R. 
Bartlett, essentially a working li- 
brary in the departments of geog- 
raphy and archaeology ; the late 
Caleb Fiske Harris, whose col- 
lection of American poetry is 
perhaps the finest in the country; 
Sidney S. Rider, whose specialty 
is Rhode-Island history ; Prof. 
A. S. Packard, jun., rich in en- 
tomological and embryological 
works; Royal C Taft and Alex- 
ander Farnum, each of which 
is rich in the English classics. 
Joseph J. Cooke left a large and 
valuable library containing, 
among other curiosities, an Eliot 
Indian Bible and a collection of 
manuscript letters, written during 
the Revolutionary war by Gen. 
Washington, to ' Gen. Joseph 
Reed of Philadelphia. Several

of these private libraries have 
been repeatedly found service- 
able, bv special" students, in this 
country and in Europe, so unique 
are the treasures here collected. 
Of only two of them have cata- 
logues been printed; namely,  
of" the Harris Library, pro- 
nounced by Prof. Moses_ Coit 
Tyler " the most extensive in the 
world " in the department of 
American poetry ; and of the 
John Carter Brown Library, the 
four volumes of which (but with- 
out the second edition of vol. i., 
the most valuable of all) brought 
$280 at the sale of the Menzies 
Librarv in New York in 1875. 
In 1S78 Horatio Rogers, who 
also owns a noteworthy librarv, 
published, through Sidney S. 
Rider, a valuable book on "Pri- 
vate Libraries of Providence," 
which describes in detail the pri- 
vate libraries above mentioned. 
This work maybe read with much 
profit by all lovers of books. 

License Commissioners li- 
cense the sale of pure spirituous 
and intoxicating liquors. The 
License Commission dates from 
June, 1S75. The liquor question 
is decided annually, by popular 
vote. At the November election, 
1SS1, the majority for license was 
391. The three commissioners 
are chosen by the city council, 
one annually, for a term of three 
years. Office, City Hall. 

Liederkranz, The, 51 Dor-

(the building was formerly the 



Gen. James Mansion), opened 
March" 23, [881, receives desti- 
tute persons of good character, of 
any nationality or creed, above 
the age of 60 years. Seven sis- 
ters of this Catholic sisterhood, 
under the direction of a Lady 
Superior, manage the institution, 
and, with some slight assistance 
from the inmates, do the domes- 
tic work. There are 45 inmates, 
which is as many as the building 
will accommodate. This charity 
depends wholly upon donations, 
any kinds of which are gladly re- 
ceived. Visitors admitted daily, 
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Olney-

Local Expresses.  This is a 
branch of the express business 
carried on by wagons, and for 
the accommodation of places 
near the city not readily reached 
by other expresses. Many team- 
sters do local expressing, in ad- 
dition to their other business. 
Books or slates are kept by these 
expressmen, in stores on Canal, 
Dyer, and adjacent streets ; and, 
by leaving a written order, goods 
will be called for, and carried to 
the destination to which the ex- 
press runs. A number of such 
expresses run from here to Paw- 
tucket ; and expresses also run 
to Lonsdale, Central Falls, Ash- 
ton, Attleboro', Plainville, River 
Point, Manton, E. Greenwich, E.

Low's Grand Opera House, 
Westminster and Union Sts., was 
built in 1S77 as a public hall, 
and remodelled in 1878 into a 



KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDE ACE. 



theatre. It is constructed of 
brick and iron, trimmed with 
olive stone and white brick. The 
stage is 36 ft. deep and 100 ft. 
wide. The main entrance was 
formerly on Union St., but in 
1SS2 a grand entrance was made 
on Westminster St. At the same 
time other improvements were 
made, including the putting-in of 
'a gallery, which increased the 
seating capacity from 1,300 to 
1,800; and the re-decorating of 
the whole interior. The house 
is owned by Wm. H. Low, jun., 
and is used by some of the best 
theatrical co.'s and most promi- 
nent lecturers that visit the city. 

Macullar, Parker, and Com- 
pany, who occupy one of the 
neatest mercantile' buildings in 
Providence, are known through- 
out this country as one of the 
most successful and most highly 
esteemed firms engaged in the 
manufacture of clothing  
" ready - made" and " custom - 
work." The firm have been en- 
gaged uninterruptedly in this 
business for upwards of 30 years, 
and during this period have built 
up and maintained a reputation 
for making the best and most 
satisfactory garments. An idea 
of the magnitude of their busi- 
ness can be gleaned from the 
fact that in their establishment 
upwards of 600 persons are con- 
stantly employed in making men's 
clothing which is sold exclusively 
at retail in only three stores, the 
two of Macullar, Parker, & Com- 
pany, at 400 Washington St. in 
Boston and at 1 12 Westminster St. 
in Providence, and that of Macul- 
lar & Son, at 374 Main St. in 
Worcester. One exception is to 
be made to this statement : that is, 
their white vests are sold to lead- I 



ing merchant-tailors in all parts 
of the world, these vests being a 
specialty in which this firm is not 
equalled by any competitors. To 
get their materials on the most 
favorable terms, the firm import 
their woollens directly from the 
most reputable mills in Europe ( 
and own a large interest in 
well-known mills in this coun- 
try. They keep the same persons 
constantly at work on the same 
parts of the same kind of gar- 
ments, in order to get the most 
perfect results. Every piece of 
goods is thoroughly and scientifi- 
cally tested before it is cut up, 
so that every garment may be 
guaranteed in all its details. No 
customer ever becomes justly dis- 
satisfied, for every thing that any 
rational person can expect of a 
business house is performed by 
this firm. It has become an ad- 
mitted fact, that as a model manu- 
facturing establishment, where 
employes are paid liberally and 
treated generously, and where 
they are provided with com- 
fortable and healthy apartments 
in which to do their work, there 
is none in America to be com- 
mended more highly than that of 
Macullar, Parker, & Company. 
No house in its line obtains better 
terms on purchases, and none 
serves the public more generous- 
ly. Few, if any, keep a larger 
assortment of fine clothing for all 
seasons; and none are prepared 
to make garments to order with 
greater rapidity or with more sat- 
isfaction. The Providence branch 
is in charge of Daniel B. Holder, 
who has been in the employ of 
this firm for 18 consecutive years. 
Main Street.  What is now 
known as North and South Main 
Sts. was in the early history of

Providence called the "Towne 
Streete." It was laid out in 
1638, and was the first street, 
and for many years the only one. 
The houses of the inhabitants 
were built on the east side of the 
street ; and, as there were no 
houses on the west side, an unob- 
structed view of the river could 
be had. When the people began 
to engage in commerce, wan- 
houses ami wharves were built on 
the west side; and thus in time 
the old street ceased to be "the 
greate street that lyeth by the 
waterside." In 1805, by ordi- 
nance of the town, the present 
names were given, and have since 
been retained. 

North Main St., a thorough- 
fare extending from Market Sq. 
to the town of Pawtucket, was 
once the centre of business ac- 
tivity. The principal shops were 
located here, and that part of the 
st. in the vicinity of Market Sq. 
was called Cheapside. Portions 
of it have been twice widened 
and straightened, once in 1S56 
and again in 1S70. The old Prov- 
idence Museum forms a part of 
the Gorham Manufactory on this 

St. 

'.> Main St., with its con- 
tinuation, North Main St., was 
known in the early clays of Prov- 
idence as Town St. It is a nar- 
row, irregular business thorough- 
fare, extending from Market Sq. 
to India St., and contains but few- 
modern structures. Many of the 
wealthier residents of the town 
built fine houses here ; but these 
have mostly fallen into decay, or 
have been given up to the pur- 
poses of trade. 

Mansion House, The, cor. 
of Benefit and South Court Sts., 
nearly opposite the State House, 



is the oldest public house now 
standing in Providence. Opened 
in 17S4 under the name of Golden 
Ball Inn,  with corresponding 
sign,  it has entertained, among 
others, Presidents Washington 
and Monroe, and Gen. Lafayette. 
Manufactures.  Providence 
is noted as a seat of various and 
important manufactures. Ac- 
cording to the U. S. Census re- 
port on manufactures for 1SS0, 
there were then in the city 1,186 
manufacturing establishments ; 
with a capital of $23,573,932 ; 
employing 26,667 hands, to whom 
during the year from June 1, 1S79, 
to May 31, 1880, wages to the 
amount of $8,903,729 had been 
paid. The value of the material 
used was $21,376,467 ; value of 
goods manufactured, $39,596,653. 
The most prominent manufactures 
are jewelry, machinery, iron cast-

hostelry, and from its balcony 
public proclamations and declar- 
ations were read. 

Marine Corps of Artillery, 
Providence, chartered in 1801, 
was originally composed of sea- 
captains and seamen ; and the 
officers were required to be mem- 
bers of the Providence Marine 
Society. This restriction was 
finally removed. The company 
at first had two 32-pound iron 
cannon, and the men carried short 
swords or hangers. About the 
time of the Dorr war the company 
drilled as infantry; and about

184S it became a battery of light 
artillery, said to have "been the 
first volunteer battery in the 
United States. In 1S50, or there- 
about, the corps made an excur- 
sion to Boston, where they drilled 
on the common under the com- 
mand of Col. J. P. Balch, and so 
aroused the enthusiasm of the 
Bostonians that a battery was 
org. there ; and the officers came 
to Providence, and were drilled 
by the officers of the Marine 
Corps in the Arsenal. The Ma- 
rine Corps was the parent of 
all the light artillery sent from 
Rhode Island during the civil 
war ; all the batteries having 
been organized and recruited un- 
der its supervision, and most of 
the prominent officers were 
trained in its armory. Eight 
three-years' batteries were sent 
out, and the company went out 
on two successive occasions for 
three months each time. The 
organization is at present an in- 
dependent chartered company, 
and is represented in the active 
militia by Battery A, Light Artil- 
lery, R.I. M. All the officers 
and most of the men in Bat. A are 
members of the Marine Corps. 
The armory of the company is in 
the Arsenal on Benefit St. 

Marine Society, The Provi- 
dence, incorporated in 179S, was 
established by commanders of 
vessels  past or present  "for 
their relief in distress, and for 
the relief of their widows and 
children ; " but, to further its 
benevolent designs, also admits 
persons of other occupations, as 
honorary members. At the an- 
nual dinner, which occurs July 4, 
roast pig is served in accordance 
with an old sea custom. G. W. 
Brown, sec'y. 



Markets.  There are now no 
city markets, so-called, in Provi- 
dence. Only two of these relics 
of the past are standing : the Old 
City Building, built in 1773 (see 
Old City Building), and the New 
Market - House, junc. of High 
and Broad Sts., which was built 
in 1827, and has been little al- 
tered. A sort of open-air market 
exists on Dyer and S. Water 
Sts., where garden - produce of 
various kinds may be bought 
every morning from farmers' and 
hucksters' wagons. 

Market Sq., on the east side 
of the Providence River, adjoins 
the Great Bridge. All the horse- 
car lines meet, and most of them 
start here. The Board of Trade 
and What Cheer Buildings are 
on this square. 

Marriages in Rhode Island 
can be solemnized only by reg- 
ularly ordained clergymen or 
elders of any religious denomina- 
tion (or ministers of any society 
professing to meet for religious 
purposes, and sustaining a min- 
ister publicly ordained), who 
must be domiciled in this State ; 
or by either justice of the Supreme 
Court. Exceptions are made 
only in the cases of wardens 
in the town of New Shoreham, 
and of members of the Society 
of Friends. Residents of this 
city intending to be married in 
Providence, or elsewhere in this 
-State, must file their intentions, 
and procure a license or certifi- 
cate, at the office of the City Re- 
gistrar, City Hall. Residents of 
any State other than Rhode 
Island, intending to be married 
in this city, must do the same.

Methodist Episcopal De- 
nomination.  The first Method- 
ist preacher to visit and preach 
in Providence was Rev. Freeborn 
Garrettson, who, in travelling 
from Boston to New York, 
passed through Providence, 
April, 17S7, and preached two ser- 
mons in a Congregational church. 
Jesse Lee visited Providence 
in 1790; and Bishop Asbury, 
in 1791. The first regularly ap- 
pointed preacher to Rhode Island 
was the Rev. Lemuel Smith, who, 
in 1792, was assigned to the first 
circuit in this State, and to be 
preacher in charge at Providence. 
Until 179S the itinerant preachers 
made occasional visits ; but in 
that year Joshua Hall was sta- 
tioned in Providence, and the first 
class was organized by him. For 
many years the progress of the 
denomination was slow. Services 
were held in private houses, and 
often there was no regular 



preacher. In 1S11 or 1812a small 
school-house on " Cat Alley," 
now Middle St., was hired ; and 
services were held here until the 
erection of a church on Aborn 
St., cor. of Washington, in 1S16. 
This house was abandoned for 
the Chestnut-st. church, erected 
1822. The Chestnut-st. society 
is the parent of all the other M. E. 
churches in the city, each org. 
having either sprung directly 
from this body or from a society 
which has originated from it. 
There are now in the city 8 soci- 
eties of this denomination, with 7 
church edifices, several of them 
large and costly structures ; the 
total membership is 2,126; pro- 
bationers, 172 ; local preachers, 
13. For a list of the churches,

ground and pure air render it a

In 1881 nearly three-fourths of 
the new buildings of this ward 
were erected in this section. 

Mowry and Goff's English 
and Classical School has at- 
tained a rank second to no simi- 
lar institution in this country. In 
1864 Wm. A. Mowry, who for 
five years had been at the head 
of the English and scientific de- 
partment of the Providence High 
School, and a teacher there for a 
period previous, projected an 
English and classical school, the 
underlying principle of which 
was " The fear of the Lord is the 
beginning of wisdom," and the 
object of which was to give ;o 
boys a thorough moral and intel- 
lectual education, with due at- 
tention to their physical needs,  
in short, thoroughly to fit young 
men for business, for scientific 
schools, or for college. He 
opened the school in February, 
1S64, in the Lyceum Building, 
with 53 scholars. In September 
of the same year he associated 
with himself his present part- 
ner, Chas. B. Goff, a college mate 
and friend, then, and, for half a 
dozen years previous, the princi- 
pal of the Fall River High School. 
The motto of Mowry and Goff 
was, " Deo doctrina-que ; " and, 
under this, the school has experi- 
enced nothing but uninterrupted 
prosperity. In 1S65, the accom- 
modations becoming too small, 
two full stories were obtained in 
the Narragansett Block. Five 
years later additional room be- 
came a necessity ; and the school 
was moved to the Fletcher 
Building, where it remained till 
the completion, in 1S75, f tne 
present building, which Mowry 



and Goff themselves erected ex- 
pressly for school use. It is one 
of the best constructed and most 
serviceable structures of its kind 
to be seen in any city. The two 
large upper floors, 91x94 feet 
each, are utilized for the school, 
while the lower floor is occupied 
by the Providence Public Library. 
It is situated on Snow St., ex- 
tending through to Moulton St., 
bet. Westminster and Washing- 
ton Sts. It is thoroughly fitted 
out with all appliances and ap- 
paratus necessary to make it 
wholesome and useful. It was 
formally dedicated April 22, 1875, 
with interesting exercises, which 
were published in the school's 
report for that year. The cata- 
logue for 1SS2 shows 14 instruct- 
ors and 263 scholars. The 
school has had 2,000 pupils, and 
has already 250 graduates, many 
of whom are prosperous men, in 
various professional and business 
pursuits.

Music Hall, 276 Westminster 
St., is used for concerts, lectures,

A gallery runs along three sides, 
and an upper gallery in the rear. 
The hall contains a fine and 
powerful Hook & Hastings con- 
cert organ. Stage accommodates 
an orchestra of 60, and 300 sing- 
ers. Seating capacity of audito- 
rium, 2,200. The hall was en- 
larged, and the interior arrange- 
ment completely reversed, in

Mutual Health Association, 
The, Providence, was org. in

regular payments, without incur- 
ring the hazard of hopeless in- 
debtedness." It numbers 50 
members, who are assessed at 
the following rates per annum:

age, $14.00 ; woman, and children 
under age, $7.00; single man, 
$6.00 ; single woman, $5.00. W.

Narragansett, or "Nahig- 
gonsik," was the name of a tribe 
of Algonkin Indians, which, in 
the early days of the colonies, 
was the most powerful in New 
England, and at that time pos- 
sessed a territory nearly the same 
as the present State of Rhode 
Island, giving their name to its 
beautiful bay. They were friend- 
ly to Roger Williams, with whom 
they made a treaty in 1636, and 
aided the colonists against the 
Pequots. During the war with 
King Philip, chief sachem of the 
Pokanoket Indians, they were 
suspected of giving him support, 
and were twice attacked ; the sec- 
ond time being nearly annihi- 
lated. A remnant of the tribe of 
Narragansetts, numbering 1 50 in 
1877, still remains in Charles- 
town, R.I. ; and here may be 
seen, on an elevated plateau 



overlooking the sea, the royal 
burying-ground of this once fa- 
mous tribe. The Algonkin lan- 
guage, of which the Narragansett 
was a dialect, was spoken over a 
large territory, embracing a re- 
gion running N. and S. from 
Rhode Island, for some 600 
miles. A grammar of their lan- 
guage was printed by Roger Wil- 
liams in 1643. According to J. 
Hammond Trumbull, the tribal 
name was "Nanhigganeuck," as 
Roger Williams wrote it. Narra- 
ga.\\set means place, not people,  
denotes " people of the point," 
from their original location, near 
Point Judith Pond, and its W. 
branch, Fresh Pond. 

Narragansett Bay extends 
N. 28 miles into the State of 
Rhode Island. Its climate is 
mild, as compared with the rest 
of New England; and it has many 
attractions in its numerous shore 
resorts, valuable fisheries, and 
points of historical interest. It 
receives the Providence, Paw- 
tuxet, Warren, Taunton, and Ap- 
ponaug Rivers; the last two 
through their estuaries, Mount 
Hope Bay and Greenwich, or 
Cowesett, Bay. The islands of 
Rhode Island and Canonicut di- 
vide it at its mouth; forming 
three passages for vessels, known 
as the E., W., and Middle Pas- 
sages. The E. passage is also 
called Seaconnet River. On 
Narragansett waters was com- 
mitted the first hostile act against 
the British goverment, when, in 
1769, the Newport people sank 
his Majesty's armed sloop " Lib- 
erty," and burned her boats ; and 
here, at Gaspee Point, was shed 
the first blood in the Revolution- 
ary War, at the capture and de- 
struction of the British schooner

"Gaspee," by Providence and 
Bristol men, in 1772. In summer, 
when the bay is rilled with sailing- 
craft of every description, from 
the stanch and handsome steamers 
down to dingy but suggestive fish- 
ing-dories and oyster-boats, a sail 
between its green banks, adorned 
on every hand with picturesque 
cottages and villas, pavilions, and 
hotels, is an enjoyment not to be 
forgotten. 

Narragansett Boat-club, 
org. 1838, incorporated 187 1, 
was originally composed of 
young business and professional 
men, many of whom have since 
held important offices in the State 
and Nation. The membership 
still consists of the same classes. 
The club had a boat-house at the 
head of Hopkins and Pomroy's 
wharf, foot of Orange St., but sold 
it at auction Sept. 27, 1SS2. This 
old building was originally lo- 
cated on the Seekonk, and was 
towed in two sections from there 
to its late position. A two-story 
front was then added, the second 
floor of which was the club-room. 
It is intended to build a new house 
on the Seekonk in 1SS3, at a cost 
of about $5,000. The number of 
boats belonging to the club is 
about 20, including single and 
crew boats. Officers are,  
prest., A. C. Tingley; vice-prest., 
Samuel Ames ; captain, Edward 
H. Tingley ; lieutenant, Clarence 
H. Gardner ; sec'y, Nelson S. 
Davis ; treasurer, Wm. U. Xisbet. 
Narragansett Club.  In 
1S65 George T. Paine and sev- 
eral other gentlemen associated 
themselves under the above title, 
for the purpose of reprinting 
the works of, and in relation to, 
Roger Williams. The first vol- 
ume was published in 1S66, and 



the sixth and last in 1874 ; previ- 
ous to which time, however, the 
entire management and expense 
of the undertaking had been as- 
sumed by Mr. Paine. 

Narragansett Hotel, con- 
ducted by Chapin & Robinson, is 
one of the largest, grandest, best 
furnished, and most satisfactorily 
kept hotels in the world. It is 
one of the most imposing struc- 
tures of any kind in Providence, 
and is situated in the heart of the 
city. Surrounded by smaller 
buildings, it stands forth as a 
huge and majestic building, com- 
manding the attention of every 
visitor. It is 8 stories high on 
the inner court, although only 7 
stories are seen from the street. 
It fronts on Broad, Dorrance, and 
Eddy Sts. ; the frontage being re- 
spectively 134, 1S1, and 1S4 ft. 
The exterior is plain and sub- 
stantial, of Trenton pressed brick; 
the lower story, the window-cap- 
pings, and the ornaments being 
of iron. The interior, however, 
while equally substantial, is not 
at all plain, although every thing 
is in excellent taste. There are 
three entrances, one on Dorrance 
St., another on Eddy St., and the 
third on Broad St. The main en- 
trance, 17 ft. wide, is about mid- 
way on Dorrance St., and opens 
directly to the main staircase hall, 
which is 30 ft. by 67 ft. and 29 ft. 
high, the ceiling forming an im- 
mense skylight. An open court, 
30 by 150 ft., occupies the whole 
centre of the building. These 
dimensions give some idea of the 
generous proportions of this 
hotel ; for in few hotels anywhere 
have the rooms, parlors, dining- 
halls, chambers, etc., been made 
' so large and high as those in the 
I Narragansett. All of the Dor- 



KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 



rance-st. front on the second 
floor is devoted to delightful par- 
lors. The grand dining-hall is 40 
by 90 ft., and 27 ft. high. The 
chambers are supplied with every 
modern convenience, most of them 
having baths and closets adjoin- 
ing, and all having open grates, 
with marble mantles. The ven- 
tilation has been specially pro- 
vided for. The 225 rooms are 
admirably furnished and thor- 
oughly taken care of. The hotel 
is provided with elevators, tele- 
graph and telephone offices, bar- 
ber-shops, and every other con- 
venience usual to leading hotels. 
The lunch-room is the finest and 
most frequented of its class. 
The hotel was begun in 1874, 
and finished in 1878, at a cost of 
almost $[,000,000. The architect 
was Win. R. Walker. It was 
begun by the Narragansett Hotel 
Co., chartered in 1854. After 
$680,000 had been invested, the 
property was bought by Geo. R. 
Phillips. A new co., the Wheaton 
Hotel Co., was then org'd under 
an old charter dating back to 
1854 ; and the hotel was finished a 
few years afterward, creditably to 
all concerned. Both managers 
are men of considerable experi- 
ence in first-class hotels. Edwin 
Chapin has been prominently 
identified with such hotels as the 
Fifth-avenue of New York, the 
Delavan of Albany, the Conti- 
nental of Philadelphia, the Tre- 
mont and the Revere of Boston, 
the Occidental of San Francisco, 
etc. M. P. Robinson, although a 
young man, is widely and favor- 
ably known as a genial and com- 
petent host ; having made an 
extensive acquaintance with the 
travelling public at the Massa- 
soit House at Springfield, the 



Kennard at Cleveland, the Tre- 
mont House and the Hotel 
Brunswick of Boston, and latterly 
at the Narragansett, where he 
and Mr. Chapin have been asso- 
ciated for the past two years. 
Every thing considered, Prov- 
idence can well boast of her 
grand hotel ; for no city of its size 
has one which equals, and few 
cities of any size have hotels to 
surpass, the Narragansett. The 
Wheaton Hotel Co., owners of 
the Narragansett Hotel, is com- 
posed chiefly of wealthy citizens 
of Rhode Island; the president 
being Ex-Gov. Henry Lippitt, 
one of the best known citizens of 
Providence. 

Narragansett Trotting-Park 
is in the town of Cranston, bet. W. 
Khmvood and the Cranston Print- 
Works. It has a good track and 
extensive grounds. The annual 
fairs of the Society for the En- 
couragement of Domestic Indus- 
try are held here ; and twice  in 
1S67 and 1S73  tne New-Eng- 
land Agricultural Society held its 
fairs on these grounds. 

Narragansett Yacht - Club, 
incorporated at the January ses- 
sion of the State Legislature, 
1S82, is composed of a number of 
wealthy Providence gentlemen and 
others, whose object is to increase 
the interest in yachting matters, 
and to bring the advantages of 
Narragansett Bay to the notice of 
yachtmen in general. The club 
has a landing at Newport, and a 
landing and club-house on Co- 
nanicut Island, Narragansett Bay. 
12 or 15 schooner yachts, and 
about the same number of sloops, 
belong to the club, some of them 
being New-York yachts. The 
officers are Henry Lippitt, com.;

Natural History.  See 

Franklin Society. 

Natural - History Store of 
Soutlnvick & Jencks is the only 
one in Rhode Island. In some 
respects it is one of the most 
noteworthy places of its class in 
America. For instance, here is 
offered for sale the largest assort- 
ment of skins of North-Ameri- 
can birds offered anywhere ; and 
in birds' eggs there is an almost 
unequalled collection. In all de- 
partments of natural history, 
such as minerals, birds, dried 
grasses and flowers, shells, and 
various natural curiosities, a large 
and interesting exhibit is always 
to be seen. A specialty is made 
of stuffing birds. The business 
was established in 1876 by the 
present firm, and is carried on at 
No. 258 Westminster St. 

Neutakonkanut Hill, or, as 
called in the title-deed given by 
the Narragansetts to Roger Wil- 
liams, " Ye Great Hill of Not- 
quonckanet," is an eminence just 
beyond the terminus of the Plain- 
field-st. route of horse-cars. It 
is not difficult of ascent ; and from 
its summit a magnificent view is 
obtained, extending eastward as 
far as Prospect Hill, and N. and 
S. from Pawtucket to Fall River. 
With a field-glass it is said that 
Mt. Wachuset is visible. Neuta- 
konkanut Hill may be seen from 
Prospect Terrace. This hill has 
lately been divided into house-lots, 
and access from Plainfield St. is 
now forbidden. 

New England Manufactur- 
ing Jewellers' Association is 
the name adopted, April 3, 18S2, 



by the Providence Jewellcrs'Club, 
an organization formed in 1S79, 
not merely for the promotion of 
social enjoyment, but to advance 
and protect the jewelry manufac- 
turing and kindred interests. The 
new rooms of the association are 
in the Wilcox Building, Weybos- 
set St., and are open to non-mem- 
ber residents of the city, from 9 
A. M. to 6 P. M. on Mondays only. 
Regular business meetings are 
held on the first Saturday in each 
month. The society numbers 
nearly 200 members. John A. 
McCloy, sec'y. 

Newmarket, plain, and un- 
modified by Sq. or St., similar to 
"Cornhill" in London or Bos- 
ton, is a name applied to the tri- 
angular space formed by the junc. 
of High, Broad, and Chestnut 
Sts. Its name is derived from 
the old Market Building which 
stands there. The Central Bap- 
tist and Beneficent Congregational 
churches front on this space. 

Newspapers.  There are 
nearly 20 local newspapers, of 
various kinds. The dailies, ar- 
ranged in the order of their sen- 
iority, are as follows :  

Providence Daily Journal, a 
Republican morning paper, pub- 
lished by Knowles, Anthony, & 
Danielson, and edited by George 
W. Danielson, 2 Weybosset St. ; 
established in 1S29. Until the 
summer of iSSl.the paper was a 
large folio in form ; but on July 1 
it appeared as a quarto, 24 x 37 ^2  
The Journal was the first paper 
to introduce in this city the stere- 
otype system, which it adopted 
in 1S81. Its printing-machinery 
consists of two Hoe -web per- 
fecting presses, with a capacity 
of 15,000 papers per hour each. 
Terms, $S a year, 3 cents a copy.

Nonotuck Silk Co., although 
its works are a hundred miles 
away, is well known to the people 
of Rhode Island, who are the 
constant purchasers of immense 
quantities of its knitting, sewing, 
etching, and other silks known as 
the "Nonotuck," "Corticelli," 
and "Florence" brands. The 
business of the Nonotuck Co. 
was established forty years ago, 
and here was made the first sew- 
ing-machine twist produced any- 
where in the world. The works 
are in the villages of Florence 
and Leeds, in the town of North- 
ampton, Mass. They are some

of the prettiest and most inter- 
esting mills in this country. Their 
floor surface is upwards of 100,000 
sq. ft. 800 persons are employed, 
and 175,000 pounds of raw silk 
are consumed each year. A great 
specialty is made of the " Flor- 
ence Knitting-Silk." The Co. 
received medals at Philadelphia 
in 1876, at Paris in 1S78, and at 
many other exhibitions and fairs.

Odd Fellows' Beneficial As- 
sociation of the State of Rhode 
Island was org. in 186S, for "the 
creation and perpetuation of a 
fund for the widows and orphans 
of its members." It is composed 
exclusively of Odd Fellows, who 
must have attained the third de- 
gree, but who may be residents 
of this or any other New-Eng- 
land State. It numbers over 
1,000 members, and pays a death 
benefit of Si, 000. Its manage- 
ment is intrusted to a board of 
directors elected annually, repre- 
senting each lodge in the State 
of Rhode Island. Sec'y, Wm. E. 
Whiting, Butler Exchange. 

Odd Fellows, Independent 
Order of.  There are 15 lodges 
in the city, besides one in E. 
Providence and one in Olneyville 



(Johnston), numbering in all 
some 2,200 members. They have 
an invested fund of more than 
$S6,ooo. Friendly Union Lodge, 
No. 1, received its original char- 
ter in 1829. Although its charter 
has been twice revoked and re- 
newed, it may justly claim to be 
the oldest in the State of Rhode 
Island, in which there are 43 
lodges, 17 encampments, and 
nearly 4,800 members. In addi- 
tion to the ledges, there are in 
Providence 6 encampments, and 
6 degrees of the Daughters of 
Rebckah.

Old Brick House, An, stands 
at Nos. 537 and 539 N. Main St. 
It is a three-story structure, with 
a gambrel roof, and was built in 
1752 or 1753, by Elisha Brown. 
About one-third of its length on 
the north side has been taken 
down, and a wooden cottage built 
on its site. The central window 
of the three now remaining on the 
north side was evidently the origi- 
nal centre of the building.

Old Streets.  The first street, 
at the first, was merely a shore 
road, on the east side of the 
Providence River, running along 
in front of the "plantations," 
or "home lots," afterwards 
called the " Towne Streete," now 
known as S. and N. Main Sts. 
It led from Fox Point up into the 
country. Gradually lanes, finally 
widened and fenced as streets, 



were opened eastward, such as 
"Olney's Lane," now Olney St. ; 
Power's Lane, now Power St. 
Roads were opened to the ferries 
on the two rivers, Seekonk and 
Blackstone, leading to Massa- 
chusetts. After the building of 
Weybosset Bridge (Great Bridge), 
in 1704, roads were opened 
westward, now Weybosset St., 
Broad St., and High St., leading 
to Pawtuxet and Johnston. West- 
minster St. was opened in 1763, 
when a movement was pro- 
posed to establish a new town- 
ship on the west side named 
Westminster. Streets were grad- 
ually opened in every direction as 
the town grew till it became a 
city.  Frederic Dennison. 

" Old Town House," The, 
stood at the cor. of College and 
Benefit Sts., where the Court 
House is now located. A plain 
wooden structure, it was built for 
a church in 1723, and seventy 
years later purchased for a town- 
house. It was taken down in 
1S60. 

Omnibuses and Stages.  
In the times before the introduc- 
tion of railroads, the stage-coach 
was an important institution. 
During the summer of 1829 there 
were 328 stage-coaches a week 
running bet. Boston and Provi- 
dence, besides the local stages 
running to points within a dozen 
miles of the city. The contrast 
bet. those days and these is well 
illustrated by the small number 
of such conveyances at present in 
use, and especially when the 
population has since then in- 
creased more than five times. At 
present there are not more than 
a score of stages running from 
the city, and these only to places 
comparatively near. The longest

city at present is to Danielson- 
ville, Conn., a distance of about 
25 miles. The following are the

active and honorary, all of whom 
are professional musicians.

Park Garden, Broad St., is a 
carefully planned summer garden, 
several acres in extent, and well 
laid out in lawns, lakes, paths, 
etc. The grounds contain a pa- 
vilion for theatrical and other 
entertainments, summer-houses, 
and other buildings, chiefly in the 
Japanese style. In the evening, 
the electric light, hundreds of gas- 
jets, and pyrotechnic displays 
furnish brilliant illuminations. 
"Pinafore" on the lake made a 
decided hit in 1S79. In the sea- 
son the grounds are open after- 
noons and evenings. Horse-cars 
marked "Park Garden" start 
from Market Sq. 

Parks.  Providence needs, 
perhaps, fewer large public parks 
and breathing-spaces than any 
city of its size in the Union. For, 
situated as it is upon a number 
of steep hills and gentle slopes,

very heart of the town the large 
body of water called the Cove, 
with the regular ebb and flow of 
its tide, is thought to contribute 
materially to the general health. 
In addition to these natural ad- 
vantages, few houses in Provi- 
dence are built in blocks; a large 
majority of the dwellings being 
detached, and surrounded with 
more or less ground. The free- 
dom and fresh air which this 
mode of building insures go far 
to compensate for the limited 
number and small size of parks 
in the city, though several of these 
are not unworthy of notice. Prov- 
idence may, however, soon be 
presented by one of its citizens, 
Henry T. Beckwith, with about 
30 acres in the N. part of the 
city, bordering upon North St. 
and East Av., to be used as a 
public park, commemorative of 
the valuable services rendered the 
State by the French troops dur- 
ing i7So-Si,when they encamped 
here under the brave commander- 
in-chief, Count de Rochambeau. 
Of the three names proposed for 
this valuable and appropriate gift, 
 French, Lafayette, or Rocham- 
beau Park,  the last is the most 
approved. The obstacle in the 
way of Providence getting this 
park is made apparent in the fol- 
lowing note (Oct. 11, 18S2) from 
Mr. Beckwith to the editor of this 
book :  

" I have fully intended to give the 30 
acres mentioned for a public park, but 
now don't know whether I shall or not. 
The people are so foolish as to talk of fill- 
ing the Cove (which you also mention in 
the enclosed proof), and devoting it to 
railroad purposes, mainly freight-yards. 
I want to add to the public grounds the 
city has; but if any is to be destroyed I 
shall not furnish a substitute for it, so 
must wait and see. I am very sorry that 
it is so. No other city would have such 



ideas. Park Rochambeau we have called 
my land, as being a more euphonious ex- 
pression than Rochambeau Park, and it is 
also according to the French idiom. The 
city owns 37 acres land at Field Point, at 
the entrance of the harbor, being the 
quarantine station. There is nothing to 
prevent that being made a park if they 
are so disposed. Abbott Park and the two 
that are dignified with the names of 
Washington and Franklin are very small 
pieces of ground. Resp'y yours, 

H. T. Beckwith.

Pawtucket : at the falls on 
Blackstone's or Pawtucket River, 
" which river is called in Indian 
Pautuck (which signifies a fall) 
because there the fresh waterfalls 
into the salt water."  J. Ham- 
mond Trumbull. 

Pawtucket is an important 
manufacturing town, on the Black- 
stone River, about 5 miles from 
Providence. The manufacture 
of cotton cloth, yarns, and thread, 
and many kinds of machinery, 
are the chief industries. The 
Boston and Providence and the 
Providence and Worcester rail- 
roads pass through the place. 
The population in 1S80 was over 
19,000. An attempt in 1882 to 
incorporate it as a city was un- 
successful. Pawtucket is prac- 
tically a part of Providence, and 
Central Falls in the town of 
Lincoln is practically a part of 
Pawtucket. 

Pawtuxet is a small village at 
the mouth of the Pawtuxet River, 
about 5 miles from Providence. 
It is mainly a place of residence 
for Providence people, and is 
reached from the city by the horse- 
cars. A settlement was made

herein 163S, two years after Roger 
Williams settled at Providence, 
by four men from Providence ; 
and the place has had since then 
a distinct existence. 

Pawtuxet River rises in the 
north-western part of the State, 
and empties into Narragansett 
Pay. It is the source of the 
city's water-supply. For 3^ miles 
from the village of Pawtuxet to 
the Pettaconsett pumping-station, 
it is a great resort in summer for 
boating - parties. Some of the 
scenery is extremely picturesque. 

Pawtuxet Water is furnished 
to the city at the rate of about 
3,700,000 gallons per day. The 
average cost to consumers is 3 
cts per 100 gallons. Pesides 
Providence, several suburban 
towns are supplied with this 
water. 

Peace Society, The Rhode- 
Island, org'd in 18 18 and incorp'd 
in 1S25, is interesting as the old- 
est peace-society in the country. 
It has been active and influential, 
has been represented at most of 
the large peace conventions that 
have been held on both sides of 
the ocean, and has repeatedly ex- 
erted its influence by various 
means for the establishment of an 
international congress. Amos 
Perry, sec'y.

Pettaconsett Pumping-Sta- 
tion is on the Pawtuxet River, in 
the town of Cranston, about 6 
miles from Providence City Hall. 
The erection of the works here 
was begun April, 1S70. A tem- 
porary engine-house on the bank 
of the river, containing a " Worth- 
ington Duplex " engine with a 



pumping capacity of 5,000,000 gal- 
lons a day, was first built, and still 
continues in use. The perma- 
nent engine-house  a beautiful 
structure of brick and stone, with 
a standpipe rising above the 
roof to a height of 1S6 ft.  was 
built in 1873, and holds a Cornish 
engine. Peneath this house a bed 
of quicksand of great depth was 
found ; and the motion of the en- 
gine had caused the standpipe to 
settle to such an extent that in the 
autumn of 1879 it became neces- 
sary to drive 40 piles, about 25 
ft. in length and 10 in. in diameter, 
under and around the pump, and 
also around the standpipe. After 
this work, which occupied about 
2 months, the engine was again 
started Nov. 22, 1879 5 atl< ^ a ^" 
though it worked better than be- 
fore the repair was made, the 
capacity of 9,000,000 gallons first 
intended could not be attained, 
and it soon became evident that 
new machinery must be substi- 
tuted. This fact was set forth 
by Mayor Hayward in his ad- 
dress in Jan., 1881. To meet 
this want a contract was made 
June 7, 1SS1, with the Hon. Geo. 
H. Corliss, to furnish one of his 
engines ; and soon afterwards 
preparations for its erection were 
begun. This engine, which is 
housed on the river-bank almost 
in the rear of the Cornish en- 
gine-house, when tested May 22 
to 27, 1882, pumped at the rate 
of 9,000,000 gallons in 24 hours, 
and even higher at times, and 
proved very satisfactory in every 
respect. It consumed far less fuel 
than the Cornish engine, for the 
same amount of work done, and 
in various other ways was more 
effective. A test of the Cornish 
engine, made in the beginning of 



So KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 



1882, showed that it pumped but 
a little over 6,000,000 gallons per 
24 hours ; which unfavorable re- 
sult is to be attributed partly, at 
least, to the settling of the pump- 
well in 1879. 

Pharmaceutical Ass'n, The 
Rhode - Island, established in 
1874, has for its object the dif- 
fusion of scientific knowledge 
anong pharmacists and others. 
It encourages the system of ap- 
prenticeship now in vogue in the 
State. Any registered pharma- 
cist or assistant registered phar- 
macist, active or retired, may be- 
come a member. Initiation fee, 
$3; annual tax, $2. Chas. A.

Philip, or Metacomet, son of 
Massasoit, the chief of the Po- 
kanokets, was one of the most 
troublesome Indians in the early 
days of R. I., and carried on the 
" King Philip's War." 

Phillips & Co., Thomas, is 
the oldest, most prominent, and 
most successful house in its line 
in this State. The business was 
established in 1804 by Josiah 
Keene, who conducted it until 
1830, when he was succeeded by 
Calder & Phillips, whose success- 
ors in 1S53 were the present firm 
of Thomas Phillips & Co. Al- 
though new departments have 
been added from time to time, the 
successive firms have always 
ranked prominent among their 
competitors in each of the several 
departments. The business now 
comprises the manufacturing of 
lead pipe and plumbers' supplies, 
and also of all kinds of copper 
work and brass fittings. In copper 
work the firm have important 
specialties, such as drying-ma- 
chinery, boiling-worms, slasher 



cylinders, vacuum-pans, and other 
apparatus used in print-works, 
bleacheries, sugar-refineries, etc. 
In connection with manufacturing 
and extensively dealing in lead 
pipe, sheet lead, tin pipe, pig lead, 
solder, sheet and bolt copper, and 
plumbers' supplies, the firm do the 
greatest amount of local plumb- 
ing work for factories, places of 
business, and residences. More- 
over, they rank as eminent sani- 
tary and hydraulic engineers, and 
in this department have accom- 
plished many noteworthy under- 
takings, particularly so in Boston's 
palatial Hotel Vendome, and 
Providence's magnificent Nar- 
ragansett Hotel, for both of 
which they supplied all the plumb- 
ing and ventilating apparatus. 
In supplying apparatus for mills 
and factories the firm show 
great ingenuity in contriving 
innumerable different devices for 
copper and brass apparatus which 
various industries require. In 
this department the firm's patrons 
are scattered throughout America, 
Cuba, and the West Indies. The 
buildings in which is carried on 
this industry make no imposing 
appearance. They are old and 
of wood, but they are thoroughly 
equipped with approved machine- 
ry and appliances. They occupy 
the whole of the block on the 
west side of South Main St., Nos. 
73 to 85 inclusive, extending from 
Mark Lane to Crawford St. 
They are two stories high above 
the basement, and have a frontage 
of 80 feet, and an average depth 
of about 70 feet. There are nearly 
125 employees, among whom are 
quite a number who have been 
employed here upwards of twenty 
consecutive years. Although the 
style of the firm has remained 



KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 



unchanged for the past thirty 
years, the sole manager during the 
past fifteen years has been George 
R. Phillips, who is recognized as 
a philanthropic and patriotic citi- 
zen. He is a son of Thomas 
Phillips, and a native of Provi- 
dence. In many noteworthy local 
enterprises of recent times he has 
taken a foremost and an active 
interest. In public life, too, he has 
held various local offices of trust, 
bestowing on all of them his ut- 
most fidelity, although at the same 
time occupied with the minute 
details of his own large and 
tricate business, of which he 
in reality the actual head, and with 
which he has been connected ever 
since 1848.

dormer windows, etc., of galvan- 
ized iron. The interior arrange- 
ments are most commodious and 
complete, particular attention hav- 
ing been given to ventilation and 
hygiene ; and it is believed that 



this schoolhouse is surpassed by 
none of similar grade in the 
country. Its total cost was $135,-

before their pay is cut off by the 
city, and $2 a day afterwards ; 
pays $200 upon the death of the 
wife of a member, and $700 upon 
the death of a member, the sums 
to meet which are procured by 
assessment and from the treasury 
fund. Excursions in summer, and 
entertainments in winter,are given 
to accumulate funds for the ass'n. 
The membership includes nearly 
the entire police-force. 

Police - Department.  The 
executive officer is the Chief of 
Police, elected annually by the 
city council. All other superior 
officers are recommended by the 
chief, appointed by the mayor, 
and approved by the board of 
aldermen. The patrolmen are 
appointed by the chief, and con- 
firmed by the board of aldermen. 
The 185 patrolmen, including 10 
horsemen, are directly controlled 
by 6 captains, 6 lieutenants, and 7 
sergeants. Other superior officers 
are, a deputy chief and a clerk 
of police. Detailed officers are 
2 detectives, 2 warrant-officers, a 
property clerk, and a sup't of 
hacks. There are 6 districts in 
the city, each having its own sta- 
tion-house to which a certain 
number of patrolmen report. The 
number of arrests in 188 1 was 
7,714. Of these, 5,177 were for 
drunkenness. The total cost of 
the dep't in 1S80-S1 was $186,- 
S90.66. The appropriation for 
1882-83 is $200,000.

(incorp. 1S74) is composed of 
ladies and gentlemen aiming (1) 
to aid discharged prisoners in 
such way and by such means as 
will enable them to gain an hon-

and (2) to adopt such measures 
as shall seem conducive to the 
prevention of crime. A Ladies' 
Auxiliary Society (The Woman's 
Society for aiding released Fe- 
male Prisoners), formed in Jan., 
1881, under whose auspices was 
established the Sophia Little 
Home (which see), was merged 
in the ass'n at the annual meeting 
June 12, 1882. The following 
officers of the Auxiliary Society 
were then chosen as the officers 
of the consolidated org. for the

Prison, The New State, in 
the town of Cranston, was com- 
pleted in 1S78. It is a handsome 
edifice constructed of blue-stone, 
(taken from grounds belonging to 
the State institutions) with granite 
trimmings. The prison consists of 
a central building and two wings 
connected with the keeper's house 
in front, and with the mess-room, 
kitchen, and hospital in the rear, 
by means of two iron bridges. The 
cells, 252 in number, occupy the 
middle of each wing. In the 
rear is the prison-yard with an 
area of 240,000 sq. ft. ; enclosed 
by a wall 20 ft. in height, at each 
corner of which is a granite sentry 
tower. Within the yard is a two- 
story workshop. Cost of erec- 
tion, about $450,000. The archi- 
tects were Stone & Carpenter.

Prison, The Old State, Gas- 
pee St., N. of the Cove, is a mass- 
ive granite structure, two stories in 
height, completed in 1S38 at a 
cost of $51,500, or an average of 
about $1,300 per cell. In iS39the 
county jail, a smaller and more 
compact building, was added, ad- 
joining the keeper's house on the 
E. The unhealthiness and inade- 
quacy of both buildings, constant 
sources of complaint almost from 
the first, were the causes which 
led to the erection of the new 
State Prison in Cranston, whither 
the prisoners were transferred in 
1878. 

Pro-Cathedral, on Broad St., 
bet. Claverick and Foster Sts., is a 
large wooden structure, built for 
the temporary use of the Society

greatest height of 190 feet near 
the cor. of Prospect and Meeting 
Sts., from which a fine view of 
the West Side of the city is ob- 
tained. 

Prospect Terrace, Congdon 
St., East Side, was presented to 
the city by citizens of Ward II. in 
1S69. Half-way up the hillside, 
it commands a fine view of the

Providence is situated on 
Providence River, at the head of 



Narragansett Bay. It is a port 
of entry, one of the two capitals 
of Rhode Island, and the seat of 
justice for Providence County. 
It is the second city in size in 
New England, and the first in 
Rhode Island. Its latitude is 41 
49' 22" N. ; longitude, 71 24' 
48 " W. Its area comprises about 
16 sq. miles, distributed among 
ten wards nearly as follows : the 
East Side, Wards I., II., and III., 
3.1 1 sq. miles; the West Side, 
Wards IV., V., VI., VII., VIII., 
and IX., 5.S1 sq. miles ; and the 
north-western part, Ward X., up- 
wards of 6 sq. miles. The ex- 
treme length, from north to south, 
is about 54 miles ; and the extreme 
breadth from east to west, about 
4v miles. By a census taken in 
1S75 (population at the time 
100,675), of the '3< 2 75 dwellings 
enumerated, all but 351 were of 
wood. The average number of 
persons to each dwelling was 
7.5S, and to each family 4.55. 
The tax assessor's valuation of 
real ($88,987,900) and personal 
($30,208,500) property was in

taxation $14.50 per $1,000, and 
the amount of taxation $1,626,825. 
The funded city debt according 
to the last report was $9,806,188, 
which is partly offset by a sinking- 
fund amounting to $1,397,558. 
The city's floating debt on Sept. 
30, 1SS1, was $294,410, and the 
city's treasury balance at the 
same time was $323,189. The 
gross funded water debt is $5,-

Providence as a city, makes an 
interesting statistical exhibit from 
which it is seen that in fifty years 
the population of Providence has 
increased ioo,ooo. In the last 
Directory there are 43,523 
names, showing an increase of 
2,147 over the preceding year, 
and indicating a present popula- 
tion of fully 116,000. Providence 
and vicinity is one of the most 
extensive manufacturing districts 
in the United States : the prod- 
ucts are of great variety, and 
rank well in all the markets of 
the world. The homes of the 
people, and the suburbs on every 
side, always draw forth the 
praises of visitors. The public 
institutions are maintained on 
generous principles, and the pub- 
lic buildings are noteworthy for 
their architecture. The social, 
charitable, educational, and re- 
ligious interests are all sedulously 
and carefully provided for ; and 
the prosperity of the city, in its 
many details, is at present sur- 
passed by no city in the country.

Providence Association of 
Baptist Churches was formed in 
1843, of churches formerly in the 
Warren Association. The church- 
es in Providence belonging to 
this association, are the Fourth, 
Jefferson-st., Stewart-st., Cran- 
ston-st., and Roger Williams 
(Wanskuck). The total mem- 
bership of these churches, by 
report of 1882, was 1,592. The 
number of churches in the ass'n 
is 16. See Warren Association. 

Providence Association of 
Firemen, incorporated in 1829, 
comprises all the members of the 
fire department. It was formed 
" for the purpose of mutual aid 



and assistance under the calami- 
ties to which their public duties 
may expose them." Fifty cents a 
year secures to each member, if 
disabled in the performance of 
his duty, a weekly allowance of 
9.00 beside payment of all medi- 
cal charges. 

Providence Association of 
Mechanics and Manufactur- 
ers (meets quarterly, 54 North 
Main St.) was formed in 178910 
promote home manufactures, to 
cement the mechanic interest, and 
to raise a fund for supporting the 
distressed. Until 1825 the busi- 
ness meetings were generally held 
in the State House. After vari- 
ous removals, it located at Bank 
Building, on Weybosset St. In 
1S21 it established a library, and 
later a reading-room for use of 
its members and their appren- 
tices. The volumes collected, 
upwards of 6,000, were trans- 
ferred in 1S77 to the Providence 
Public Library.

minster Sts. It is open daily (ex- 
cept Sundays and holidays) from 
10 A. m. to 9 p.m. It is now in its 
fifth year, having been opened to 
the public Feb. 4, 1S78, in the 
Butler Exchange, and removed to 
its present commodious quarters 
in the summer of 1880. The 
vigorous growth of the institution 
appears destined to overcome in 
time the surprising backwardness 
which left a city of this size with- 
out a public library until 1S78. 
Severalinterestingfeatures of this 
institution may be mentioned 
here. First, its management is 
in the hands of an incorp'd bodv 
of trustees, who represent gifts 
to the library in sums of $10,000 
and more, received from Joseph 
A. Barker, the late Mrs. Anna 
Richmond, Wm. S. Slater, Alex- 
ander Duncan, Joseph R. Brown, 
Moses B. Lockwood, and others. 
The management is independent 



of the city government, although 
the library is conducted wholly 
tor the free use of all the people 
of all ages (over 14 years) and 
races. It is strange, therefore, 
that the city has never contributed 
any aid to its support,  particu- 
larly so, as such noteworthy pre- 
cedents have been established in 
Boston, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. 
Louis, and many other cities, and 
more so because a statute of the 
State of Rhode Island makes it 
possible for such support to be 
given whenever the necessary 
steps shall be taken. Second, 
a feature of this library is its at- 
tempt to render definite and spe- 
cific assistance to readers. With 
this in view, it has planned its vari- 
ous catalogues, and arranged for 
special methods of furnishing to 
readers the information which is 
available on current and standard 
topics. For instance, the library, 
from its first opening to the pub- 
lic, has posted a daily manuscript 
bulletin of references to some 
topic of current interest. Nat- 
urally these bulletins have grown, 
step by step, into, (1) a longer list 
copied by the hektograph ; (2) 
a weekly printed list in the daily 
papers, and (3) a regularly issued 
monthly periodical, the " Monthly 
Reference Lists,"  the latter 
having a subscription-list of 
over 250 names. A large part 
of these are in Providence, 
but some are in nearly every 
State in the Union, and one each 
in Canada, England, and Ger- 
many^ This institution, although 
in its infancy, has made its influ- 
ence widely "felt, and well deserves 
a hearty support from the public. 
The present number of volumes 
(Aug. 1, 1882) is 20,567, besides 
about 2,000 pamphlets. 384,624

books have been drawn from the 
library since the opening. The 
number of readers is now 18,803, 
10,260 of whom have registered 
since Aug. 1, 1878. The library 
force comprises a librarian, an 
assistant librarian, and four clerks. 
The annual reports of the libra- 
rian, William E. Foster, contain 
full information concerning the 
working of the library, with very 
complete statistical tables. Four 
of these have been issued, the 
last one being for the year ending 
Dec. 31, 1SS1. Other information 
about the library will be found in 
" The Library Journal," vol. 3, pp. 
25, 26; vol. 4, pp. 57, 169, 447, 
448; vol. 5, pp. 151, 204, 205, 
326, 327 ; vol. 6, pp. 164, 165. 

Providence River issues from 
the Cove, and enters the harbor 
at Fox Point, one mile from Great 
Bridge. It increases in width 
gradually from 100 to 900 ft., and, 
owing to the sewage which enters 
it, is usually of a muddy hue. It 
is crossed by seven bridges in 
Providence. Extensive dredging 
operations in 1S81-82 have se- 
cured a channel 17 ft. deep at 
mean low water, extending from 
Crawford-st. Bridge to Fox 
Point. 

Providence Roller-Skating 
Rink, Aborn, near Fountain St., 
built in 1S79, is sa id to be one of 
the best in the country. It occu- 
pies a wooden building, 210 ft. 
long and 101 ft. wide. Excepting 
the suitable ante-rooms, offices, 
etc., at one end, all this space is 
taken up by a large hall, with 
galleries on two sides, and in the 
centre a rink 145 by 73 ft. Open 
from 10 to 12 A. M., 2.30 to 5 and 
8 to 10.30 P. M. Broadway or 
Alt. Pleasant H. C.

Providence Washington In- 
surance Co. is the oldest joint- 
stock fire and marine ins. co. in 
New England, and the sixth oldest 
in the world. It is the largest in 
Rhode Island, the second being 
the Equitable Fire and Marine 
(noticed elsewhere). Its gross as- 
sets, including its paid-up capital 
of $400,000, amount to about 
$900,000. It is doing the largest 
and most extended business ; its 
income of over three-quarters of 
a million dollars coming chiefly 
from premiums received by up- 
wards of 300 agents scattered 
throughout the United States. 
The Co.'s charter was granted in 
1799, when the insurance busi- 
ness, although in its primitive 
state, was seen to be of such ne- 
cessity to the commercial world 
that very liberal privileges were 
granted. The offices of the Co. 
are at No. 20 Market Sq., in the 
"What Cheer Building," owned 
by the What Cheer corporation, 
in which this Co. is a large stock- 
holder. The Providence Wash- 
ington has had only four prests., 
since its incorporation 8^ years 
ago. The first was Richard jack- 
son, father of Gov. Jackson ; the 
second, Sullivan Dorr; and the 
third, John Kingsbury, who served 
till his death in 1874. The fol- 
lowing year the Newport Fire 
and Marine Ins. Co. was consoli- 
dated with the Providence Wash- 
ington ; and J. H. De Wolf was 
elected prest. J. B. Branch is 
sec'y, and George E. Bixby

ass't sec'y. The directors are 
chiefly men who have a wide- 
spread reputation for prominence 
in various industries, and include 
Wm. S. Slater, Resolved Water- 
man, Rowland Hazard, J. II. De

Providence Worsted-Mills, 
owned by Charles Fletcher, are 
probably the largest of their class 
in America. The buildings are 
all of brick, well constructed and 
admirably arranged, and cover 
three acres on Valley St. They 
are almost all new, the oldest 
having been erected in 1S75, and 
are supplied with both steam and 
water power. The machinery is 
extremely interesting, and much 
of it is to be seen nowhere else 
in this country. It was imported 
chiefly from England, Scotland, 
and France, by Mr. Fletcher, who 
has devoted a lifetime to the 
study of this one industry ; six- 
teen years having been spent in 
it in the city of Providence, where 
he has earned a well -deserved 
reputation for business capacity, 
industry, and integrity. His mills 
are models in their line. He 
gives employment to 600 persons, 
who are occupied wholly in mak- 
ing worsted, mohair, and genappe 
yarns, in white, mixed, and fancy 
colors, made up on bobbins or 
dresser-spools, and in skeins. All 
work necessary to make the 
finest yarn out of the wool as it 
is clipped from the sheep, is done 
on these premises. This necessi- 
tates sorting, scouring and drying, 
carding and preparing, combing, 
drawing, twisting, reeling and 



spooling, finishing and binding, 
coloring and bleaching. The 
various processes are well worth 
seeing, and the cleanliness of the 
several departments is worthy of 
imitation by other manufactur- 
ers.

Springfield R. R. 



KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 89 



India-st. Depot, near Fox Point, 
is the terminus of the Providence, 
Warren, & Bristol R. R. It is 
reached by horse-cars marked 
" Bristol & Fall-River Railroad," 
which leave Exchange Place 20 
minutes before the departure of a 
train. 

Union Depot, popularly known 
as "The Depot," is on Exchange 
Place in the heart of the city. All 
horse-cars pass by or very close 
to it. It is practically a double 
depot, the two parts being desig- 
nated as the "east end" and 
"west end." It is a brick struc- 
ture 625 ft. long, in the Norman- 
Gothic style, erected in 1848. In 
the east end are the termini of 
the Providence and Worcester 
R. R., and the New- York & New- 
England R. R. (to Boston). In 
the west end terminate the New- 
York, Providence, & Boston 
R. R., the New-York & New-Eng- 
land R. R. (to Hartford and the 
Hudson River); the Boston & 
Providence R. R., and the Old- 
Colony R. R. (to New Bedford 
and Fitchburg).

railroads in Boston and Worces- 
ter ; the time of all steamers, 
both freight and passenger ; 
stages, omnibuses, expresses, both 
local and general, to and from 
Providence and all points in 
Rhode Island ; horse-car tables, 
fire-alarm lists, hack and express

Rawson Fountain Society 
was org'd 1772, to supply the 



town with pure water from a 
spring near Dean St., still in ex- 
istence. Sin#e the introduction 
of Pawtuxet water, but few fami- 
lies are supplied from this source. 

Reading- Rooms.  Of read- 
ing-rooms open to the public, 
those of the Providence Public 
Library, the Union for Christian 
Work, and the Young Men's 
Christian Association, are the 
nost important. The last two 
are supplied with the daily papers, 
while that of the Providence 
Public Library is only for maga- 
zines and weekly papers. The 
Public Library reading-room is a 
spacious, attractive, and excep- 
tionally well-lighted room, and a 
most attractive place in which to 
spend an hour. That of the 
Young Men's Christian Associa- 
tion is open daily, Sundays ex- 
cepted, from 9 A. M. to 9.30 p. M., 
and has, besides the daily papers, 
secular and religious weeklies and 
popular magazines. The various 
libraries (see heading Libraries) 
also have reading-rooms. At the 
offices of the Providence "Jour- 
nal " and " Press," files of a score 
or so of papers and periodicals 
may readily be consulted. At 
the rooms of the Board of Trade 
an extensive list of papers from 
all parts of the country is re- 
ceived for the benefit of those 
who enjoy the privileges of that 
institution. The Prov. Medical 
Ass'n rooms (open at all hours) 
contain 120 medical publications.

Rhode Island, one of the 
13 original States of the Union. 
Although the smallest in area, it 
is nevertheless one of the wealth- 
iest in the Union. Its area is 
1,306 sq. miles, nearly one-fifth of 
which is water surface. It lies 
bet. the parallels of latitude 41 
and42N.,and bet. the meridians 
of longitude 71 8' and 71 53' 
W. from Greenwich. Although it 
has an ocean frontage of but 45 
miles, about 350 miles of its ter- 
ritory are washed by tide-water. 
The State, having an extreme 
length of nearly 50 miles, and an 
average breadth of 35 miles, is 



divided into two unequal divis- 
ions by Narragansett Bay. The 
soil, though somewhat rocky, is 
moderately fertile. A fine qual- 
ity of granite is quarried in 
Westerly. Cumberland, Lincoln, 
and Johnston furnish an excellent 
limestone ; and an extremely hard 
anthracite coal is mined to some 
extent in Portsmouth. There are 
also beds of iron-ore, and stone- 
quarries, in the northern part of 
the State. Extensive manufac- 
tures are carried on in Providence 
and the neighboring towns. In 
the central and southern portion 
of the State, the farming and 
fishing industries are the most 
important. The first settlement 
in Rhode Island was at Provi- 
dence, followed by settlements at 
Portsmouth and Newport. The 
colony of Rhode Island and 
Providence Plantations dates 
from the year 1647, when the 
four towns of Providence, New- 
port, Portsmouth, and Warwick 
were united under a patent or 
charter granted by Parliament in 
1643, at tne solicitation of Roger 
Williams. In the year 1651 
Providence and Warwick sepa- 
rated from the other two towns, 
but in 1654 re-united. In 1663 a 
charter of unusual liberality was 
granted by Charles II., which re- 
mained in force until the adop- 
tion of the State Constitution in 
1842. Rhode Island bore a con- 
spicuous part in the Revolution, 
furnishing to the Continental 
forces, among other distinguished 
patriots, the first naval com- 
mander, Esek Hopkins, and one 
of the most illustrious generals, 
Nathanael Greene. In 1S42 oc- 
curred the "Dorr Rebellion," an 
effort of a strong party, headed 
by Thomas Wilson Dorr, to ob- 



KING 



'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 91 



tain, by irregular methods, a new 
State Constitution. This pro- 
duced a conflict bet. the adher- 
ents of the legal State govern- 
ment and the " Dorrites," which 
terminated fortunately without 
serious bloodshed. Though the 
leader was afterwards imprisoned, 
this movement resulted in the 
framing of a new Constitution, 
which went into effect in May, 
1843. During the Civil War, out 
of a population of but 175,000, 
Rhode Island sent nearly 25,000 
men to the support of the Union 
cause. These included the Gov- 
ernor of the State, William 
Sprague, and the late Gen. Am- 
brose E. Burnside. The State is 
divided into five counties,  Provi- 
dence, Newport, Washington, 
Kent, and Bristol, named in order 
according to population. Provi- 
dence and Newport are the State 
capitals, and the most important 
cities ; Pawtucket, Woonsocket, 
Lincoln, and Warwick, the most 
populous towns. The population 
of the State by the census of 18S0 
is 276,531. The name of Rhode 
Island, applied first to the island 
of the same name,  also called 
Aquidnick,  is said to have 
been given by Adrian Block, a 
Dutch trader (from whom Block 
Island, near the mouth of Narra- 
gansett Bay, derives its name), 
who called 'it "Roodt Eylandt" 
(Red Island), from the reddish 
color of the soil; or, as some 
authorities state, "from its 
marshy estuaries, red with cran- 
berries." 



Rhode-Island Baptist State 
Convention was incorporated by 
the Rhode-Island General Assem- 
bly in 1S26, for missionary and 
educational purposes. Its mem- 
bership is composed of delegates 



from the various Baptist churches 
and auxiliary societies. Annual 
meetings are held. The conven- 
tion collects and disburses money 
for missionary purposes, and sup- 
ports a missionary and colportor. 
Rhode - Island Catholic 
Beneficial Association is a 
branch of the Irish Catholic 
Benevolent Union of America, 
meets at 9S Weybosset St. semi- 
monthly. Members are entitled 
to a weekly sick-benefit of $5.00, 
and on the death of a member 
the burial expenses are paid. 
Pres't, Thomas Cullen; sec'y, 
John Wins. 

Rhode-Island Club, org'd in 
1875, is a social club composed of 
about 65 members, including 
many leading professional and 
business men of this city. The 
club-house, well arranged and 
handsomely furnished, is at 171 
Broad St. Entrance fee, $100 ; an- 
nual assessment, $50. Pres't, 
Hon. Henry B. Anthony, U. S. 
Senator from R. I. ; Sec'y, Morris 
Ulmann. Admission procured 
only through members. 

Rhode-Island Exchange for 
Woman's Work, headquarters 
at 75 Westminster St., provides a 
salesroom for various kinds of 
women's handiwork, the objects 
contributed varying from jellies 
and cakes to Kensington embroid- 
eries and painted plaques. Each 
article is subject to the approval 
of managers who require a certain 
quality of work for acceptance. 
The exchange is supported by 
annual subscription of patrons or 
consignors, and a commission of 
10 per cent charged on sales. 

Rhode-Island Harvard Club 
was org'd in 18S2, to bring into 
closer social relations the gradu- 



92 KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 



ates of the various academic and 
professional departments of Har- 
vard University. The annual 
meeting and dinner is held at 
Newport in September, and the 
semi-annual meeting at Provi- 
dence in February. Fiftv gradu- 
ates of Harvard reside in Provi- 
dence and vicinity. The sec'y of 
the club is John H. Storer of 
Newport. 



Rhode-Island Historical So- 
ciety held its first meeting June 
29, 1822, in the old Manufac- 
turers' Hotel. Twenty-two years 
later the plain stone edifice which 
it now occupies was erected on 
Waterman St., near Prospect, 
next to the present Brown Uni- 
versity Library building; the 
lawns of the two estates being 
pleasantly continuous, without a 
barrier. The greater part of the 
9,000 volumes and 20,000 pam- 
phlets here collected relatesdirect- 
ly to the history of Rhode Island. 
The society is also rich in ancient 
documents, collections of MSS., 
etc., some of which have been 
printed in its published volumes 
of "Collections" and "Proceed- 
ings," and others of which will 
doubtless be published at no dis- 
tant day. Many miscellaneous 
articles of historical interest are 
also gathered by the society. An 
important service has been done 
for the public bv the series of 
lectures on topics 'of specific his- 
toric interest, which have been 
delivered before the society dur- 
ing the past few winters. Visit- 
ors admitted from 10 a. m. to 1 
P. M. and from 2.30 to 5 p. m. 
Prof. Wm Gammell, pres't; and 
Amos Perry, sec'y and librarian. 

Rhode-Island Horticultural 
Society was an offshoot of the 



Franklin Society, org'd in Oct., 
1S45. At its first exhibition, in 
that year, most of its contributors 
were from Massachusetts. It has 
held fairs in June and Oct., with 
few exceptions. The June fair, 
omitted for a time, has recently 
been restored. Monthly meetings 
are also held at the Lyceum Build- 
ing, 62 Westminster St., for the 
purpose of testing and discussing 
specimens of fruit and flowers. 

Rhode-Island Hospital, com- 
pleted in 186S at a cost of about 
$500,000, from plans by A. C. 
Morse, occupies ample grounds 
on Eddy St., bet. Lockwood 
and Dudley Sts. It is a private 
chanty, owing its origin to a 
generous gift of $75,000 from 
members of a single family ($40,- 
000 being from the trustees of 
Moses B. Ives, $25,000 from 
Robert H. Ives, and $10,000 from 
their sister Mrs. Charlotte R. 
Goddard), to which sum liberal 
additions have been made by the 
people of the city and State. 

The hospital structure consists 
of a central building connected 
by corridors with two large wings, 
each of which is ornamented by a 
tower. The wings contain the 
hospital wards and private rooms 
for pay -patients; the central 
building, the sup't's rooms, the 
operating and instrument room, 
museum of anatomy, library, 
chapel, and other departments. 
The staff of the institution is 
composed of 19 physicians, as- 
sisted by a consulting staff of 
12 physicians. There are also 
one medical and one surgical in- 
terne, and two externes, one med- 
ical and one surgical ; all of 
whom are regular physicians. 
552 patients were admitted in the 
year ending Sept. 30, 1881 ;

156 of whom were pay-patients. 
There are 43 endowments for 
permanent free beds.- Over 4,- 
500 out-patients were treated in 
1881. A "children's ward " was 
opened Feb. 15, 18S2. Children 
between the ages of 2 and 10 
years, if not afflicted with in- 
curable disease, are here received. 
A training-school for nurses was 
established in 1SS2. The hos- 
pital is supported by the in- 
come of a fund of about $360,- 
goo (over one-third of which is 
invested in stock of the R. I. 
Hospital Trust Co.), and by an- 
nual collections made in the city 
churches. Guarantors of defi- 
ciency supply any deficiency in 
the income. ' The pres't of the 
hospital is Prof. George I. Chace ;

Rhode-Island Locomotive 
Works is the largest establish- 
ment of its kind in New England, 
and the third largest in America. 
It is one of the greatest of the many 
manufactories in Providence, and 
second to none in importance. 
Its history is somewhat unique. 
The group of buildings and the 
grounds used and owned by this 
company were formerly the prop- 
erty of the Burnside Rifle Co., of 
which the Locomotive Works is 
in a certain sense the successor. 
The Rifle Co. was practically 
founded, and for a time conducted, 
bv Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, 
whose name it bore. During the 
war about 600,000 rifles were 
made here ; but at the close of 
the war, the demand for rifles 
having ceased, and the company 
seeking other uses for its capital 



and plant, was re-incorp'd for 
the manufacture of locomotives. 
The new company was org'd in 
1866, with a capital of $500,000; 
the stockholders being chiefly the 
old stockholders of the Rifle Co., 
and most prominent among them 
being Earl P. Mason (an original 
stockholder and the pres't and 
treas. of the Rifle Co.) and Wm. 
S. Slater. Mr. Slater became the 
first pres't of the Co., and held 
the position until his death in 1S82, 
and the vacancy has not yet been 
filled; and Mr. Mason became the 
first treas., and continued until his 
death in 1876. The directors are 
John W. Slater, Chas. F. Mason 
(vice-pres't of the Co.), Earl P. 
Mason, and Arthur Young. John 
W. Slater is the only son of the 
late pres't, and the Messrs. Mason 
are the sons of the late treas. The 
works are under the immediate 
supervision of the agt. and supt, 
J. Aug. Durgin, who was formerly 
connected with the Mason Loco- 
motive Works of Taunton, Mass., 
and more recently with the Pitts- 
burg Locomotive Works of Pitts- 
burg, Penn. Francis L. Bullard, 
(formerly of the Hinkley Loco- 
motive Works of Boston) is treas. 
and sec'y. The buildings are an 
attractive group, chiefly of brick, in 
the vicinitv of Hemlock and Val- 
ley Sts. The buildings and yards 
cover an area of eight acres owned 
by the company. The earliest 
were built in 1S61, but additions 
have been made from time to 
time as necessity demanded. The 
equipment is most complete, and 
provides ample facilities for mak- 
ing 250 locomotives a year. Em- 
ployment is given to 1,100 skilled 
men ; the pay-roll amounting to 
about $600,000 a year. The 
locomotives made here are of all

sizes, and for the various kinds of 
railroads; broad-gauge, narrow- 
gauge, elevated, etc. It is not pos- 
sible to enumerate the railroads 
using the Rhode-Island locomo- 
tives ; but they include almost all 
of the elevated railroads in New 
York, the Boston & Providence, 
the Canadian Pacific, the St. Paul, 
Minneapolis, & Manitoba, the 
St. Paul, Minneapolis, & Omaha, 
and the Chicago, Milwaukee, & 
St. Paul ; the last-named alone 
using about 140 of these locomo- 
tives. The establishment has been 
an uninterrupted success from the 
start, and to-day it is taxed to its 
utmost capacity to fill the orders 
from all parts of the world. 

Rhode -Island Lotteries.  
The newspapers about 75 years 
ago were "full of lottery adver- 
tisements, and every year several 
charters for lotteries were granted 
by the Rhode-Island General As- 
sembly. No one's moral sense 
was shocked by them." 

Rhode-Island Militia.  Ad- 
jutant General's office, 104 North 
Main St. The State militia is a 
brigade of about 1,400 men, 151 
being commissioned officers. Four 
battalions of infantry, one of cav- 
alry, and a battery of artillery, 
constitute the force, which is a 
consolidation of one brigade of 
militia, composed of various local 
military organizations, under a 
State law enacted in 1879. The 
State furnishes arms and equip- 
ments, a neat uniform of blue for 
each soldier, beside a small re- 
muneration. One of the duties 
annually performed by the bri- 
gade is a camp service of five 
consecutive days in July, Aug., or 
Sept. Oakland Beach, a shore 
resort about 10 miles from the 
city, has been the ground for 



several years. The Providence 
organizations, represented in the 
various battalions, are :  

First Battalion of infantry, com- 
panies A, B, C, and D, First Light 
Infantry Regiment, chartered 
1S1S; about 200 officers and men. 

Second Battalion of infantry, 
Co. E, Slocum Light Guards, 
org'd 1842 ; about 50 officers and 
men. 

Fourth Battalion of infantry, 
companies A and B, Burnside 
Guards, org'd 1867 ; n 5 
officers and men. 

Fifth Battalion of infantry, 
Rhode-Island Guards Regiment, 
org'd 1S65 (chiefly Irish-Ameri- 
can), companies A, B, and D,

Rhode-Island School for the 
Deaf, cor. Fountain and Beverly 
Sts., is a State institution, super- 
vised by the State Board of 
Education. It is "for the benefit 
of children incapacitated through 
deafness or deaf-mutism, total or 
partial, from receiving instruction 
in common schools." Since it 
was opened, April 2, 1877, over 40 
pupils have been instructed here,

The method of teaching is founded 
largely on the German system of 
education for deaf-mutes. Miss

Rhode-Island Societyforthe 
Encouragement of Domestic 
Industry, 12S North Main St, 
was org'd in 1S20, to promote 
industry within the State, as 
necessary to its best interests. 
Its annual meetings were held 
for nearly 30 years at Pawtuxet : 
now the yearly meetings of this 
society take place on the third 
Wi dnesday in January, in Provi- 
dence. The fairs of the society are 
held at Narragansett Park in Sep- 
tember, and the week following the 
New-England Fair. The society 
owns a museum and library. It 
has about 1,500 members. 

Rhode-Island Temperance 
Union was org'd in Oct., 186S, 
to promote " total abstinence 
from all intoxicating liquors as 
a beverage ; the suppression of 
their manufacture and the traffic 
therein ; and the alleviation of 
the sufferings of those who are 
under the curse of intemperance." 
It has kept one or more agents 
at work for over fourteen years. 
It labors in public and sabbath 
schools, on the platform and in 
the pulpit, to create and empha- 
size a correct public sentiment. 
In 1881 it declared in favor of a 
prohibitory constitutional amend- 
ment. The office is at West- 
minster St. Rev. H. W. Conant, 
sec'y. 

Rhode-Island Underwriters' 
Association is the name under 
which the Equitable and Mer- 
chants Insurance Cos. of this 
city issue a joint policy through 
their agents in the Western 



States. The business of the ass'n 
is transacted in Chicago through 
the general agents, Buckman & 
Tillinghast. 

Richmond Park is the name 
designating an enclosure on But- 
ler A v., bet. Waterman and Pit- 
man Sts., the free use of which, 
though private property, is given 
to the public by its owner, Wal- 
ter Richmond. It is a wooded 
slope overlooking the Seekonk 
River, somewhat improved, and 
provided with seats. 

Richmond - st. Congrega- 
tional Church, The Old, or 
"Tin Top" church as it was 
called, probably from the tin roof 
of its belfry, cor. of Richmond 
and Pine Sts., was begun in 1795, 
but not completed until 1807. On 
the erection of a finer structure 
opposite, this building was aban- 
doned by the Richmond-st. soci- 
ety, and for several years was a 
temporary home for various new 
societies until their churches 
should be built. It has since 
been used as a brewery, and now 
shelters within its walls a junk- 
shop and a dining-saloon. The 
style of the building is that of 
the ordinary church of its period, 
plain and rectangular, with slop- 
ing roof, and belfry in front.

Roger Williams, the founder 
of Providence, built his house on 
the east side of the river, a little 
north of what is now the cor. of 
North Main and Howland Sts.

Roger Williams Monument 
(dedicated Oct. 16, 1877), is in 
Roger Williams Park, on a pla- 
teau in front of the old Wil- 
liams House. A flight of steps 
leads to a pedestal crowned by a 
statue of Roger Williams. Below, 
History inscribes his name and 
" 1636." The monument is gran- 
ite, the figures are bronze. Total 
height, 27I ft. Cost, $18,500. 
Sculptor, Franklin Simmons. 

Roger Williams Monument 
Association, incorp'd in i860, 
was formed at the suggestion of 
Stephen Randall, a lineal descend- 
ant of Roger Williams, and the 
discoverer of his place of sepul- 
ture. The ass'n proposes, as soon 
as sufficient funds shall have been 
raised, to erect a monument to 
the founder of Rhode Island at 
some suitable spot on Prospect 
Hill, bet. Angell and Halsey Sts. 
It is to be of granite, 170 ft. in 
height. Sec'y, Amos Perry. 

Roger Williams Park is a 
tract of land comprising about 
103 acres, situated bet. Elmwood 
Av. and Broad St., near the 
Cranston line. It was the farm 
of the late Miss Betsey Williams, 
a lineal descendant of Roger 
Williams, who, at her death in 
187 1, bequeathed it to the city for 
a public park, on condition that a 
memorial to her celebrated an- 
cestor should be erected within it, 
at a cost of not less than $500. 
A fine monument, costing much 
more than the sum specified, 
stands near the Elmwood - ave. 
entrance ; and a granite memorial 
has also been placed in the an- 
cient Williams burial-ground, on 



the western margin of the park. 
Though new and but partially 
improved, the Park is still an 
attractive place for visitors. Its 
" Crystal Lake, " an artificial 
pond, covered in summer with 
row-boats, is visited in winter by 
crowds of merry skaters and 
spectators. There are croquet- 
grounds, patent swings, pleasant 
summer-houses for picnic-parties, 
and a small, interesting collection 
of animals and birds. The gam- 
brel-roofed cottage of Betsey 
Williams, carefully preserved, is 
still standing on the grounds, and 
near it the ancient well-sweep. 
What Cheer Cottage, a pictur- 
esque building erected by the 
Union Horse Railroad Co. in 
187S, is a place for resting and 
refreshments. Private parties 
are frequently given in its upper 
rooms. The Union Horse Rail- 
road Co.. has also erected a taste- 
ful pavilion at the Park terminus 
of the Elmwood route. The Park 
is reached by 4 lines of cars : viz., 
the Elmwood,  most direct,  
and the 3 South - Providence 
routes. 

Roger Williams Spring, 
near which tradition says he 
landed, is hidden from view in 
the basement of the house on the

Rumford Chemical Works 
is certainly one of the most prom- 
inent and apparently one of the 
most prosperous manufacturing 
establishments in Providence. 
Its history and success are note- 
worthy. In 1S54 George F. Wil- 
son and Eben N. Horsford, under 
the firm-name of Geo. F. Wilson 
& Co., built a chemical laboratory 
at Rumford, a busy New-England 
village, near Providence. The 
chemical works, and also the vil- 
lage, were named in honor of 
Count Rumford, who had found- 
ed at Harvard University a pro- 
fessorship on the application of 
science to the useful arts. In 
1858 the establishment was incor- 
porated as the Rumford Chemi- 
cal Works; and since then it 
has become known throughout 
this country as the manufacturer 
of superior general chemicals, 
besides several specialties of 
paramount value. The com 
pany's tract of land comprises 
about two square miles, situated 
about three miles from the city. 
Through it pass the Boston & 
Providence, and the Eastern 
Branch of the Providence & 
Worcester Railroads, and also 
the Ten-Mile and Seekonk rivers. 
The buildings cover an area of 
nearly eight acres. The main 
offices, packing and printing 



rooms, occupy two large, fine brick 
buildings, Nos. 57, 58, 59, and 60, 
South Water St., in Providence. 
The specialties of the Rumford 
Works are as follows :  

Horsford's Cream of Tartar 
Substitute. 

Horsford's Bread Preparation. 

Horsford's Phosphatic Baking 
Powder. 

Rumford Yeast Powder. 

Horsford's Acid Phosphate. 

Horsford's Anti-Chlorine. 

Horsford's Sulphite for Pre- 
serving Cider. 

Nearly all of these preparations 
are favorably known to the whole 
of the American people ; and 
perhaps justly so, for they were 
chiefly the results of many years' 
study by Professor Horsford, who 
has always been regarded as an 
eminent chemist. His title of 
professor is not one assumed. for 
commercial purposes, but was 
conferred in 1847 by Harvard 
University, where he held the 
Rumford Professorship for 16 
years; and when he retired in 
1S63 his successor was the Dr. 
Wolcott Gibbs who still holds 
the position. In 1S43 Professor 
Horsford received the degree of 
Master of Arts from Union Col- 
lege, and in 1847 Harvard Uni- 
versity conferred the same degree. 
Although his home is in Cam- 
bridge, Mass., he is frequently to 
be seen in Providence, actively at- 
tending to his duties as president 
and director of the corporation. 
The treasurer and business man- 
ager is Newton D. Arnold. The 
extensive operations of the com- 
pany are facilitated by a corps of 
general agents in various cities, 
as follows :  

W. G. Shillaber . Boston. 
H. M. Anthony. . New York.

It is difficult to give figures 
which would convey a idea of the 
magnitude or the progress of the 
company. But the sales of Acid 
Phosphate alone, which was first 
offered to the public in 1S77, 
amounted in 1SS1 to thirty times 
as much as they did four years 
previously. 

St. Aloysius Orphan Asy- 
lum (Roman Catholic), on Prairie 
Av., South Providence, is a fine 
brick building, erected in 185S, 
for orphans of both sexes. The 
institution is under the charge of 
the Sisters of Mercy, and is 
maintained by voluntary offer- 
ings from the various Catholic 
churches in the Diocese of Prov- 
idence. An average of about 
220 orphans is annually provided 
for. Visitors admitted Thursdays, 
from 2 to 4 P.M. Prairie Av. H. C. 

St. Elizabeth's Home, Atlan- 
tic, cor. Melrose St., established in 
April, 1S82, provides a home for 
women incurably sick, or convales- 
cent. Its aim is to meet the wants 
of a class for whom the hospitals 
do not provide, and who are un- 
able to pay for necessary care and 
medical attendance. Though its 
object is charitable, those that can 
are expected to pay. The Home 
has been established under the 
auspices of Grace Church So- 
ciety, but the expense of its 
maintenance is to be shared by 
other Episcopal churches in the 
diocese. 



St. Francis Cemetery.  
See Cemeteries. 

St. Francis Xavier Acad- 
emy for Young Ladies, Clav- 
erick St., near Broad, conducted 
by the Sisters of Mercy, is the 
oldest Catholic school of the kind 
in the State. It was established 
in 1 85 1, as a private school, in the 
stone building, cor. of Claverick 
and Broad Sts. A part of the 
present fine school edifice was 
erected in 1S54, but the building 
as it now stands was not finished 
until 1S65. This institution was 
a day and boarding school until 
1S73, when the boarding-school 
was removed to St. Mary's Semi- 
nary, Bay View, East Providence. 
The reason for this removal was 
the increasing number of pupils. 
At present only a day-school is 
maintained, with an average at- 
tendance of about 125. 

St. John's Church, the oldest 
Episcopal church in Providence, 
stands on North Main St., cor. of 
Church, the site of the previous 
edifice erected in 1722. The 
latter, in the steeple of which 
was hung the first church-bell in 
Providence, was first named 
King's Church, in honor of 
George I., but in 1794, for pat- 
riotic reasons, was changed to St. 
John's. A chapel adjoins the 
church. On the west side is a 
burial-ground, interesting for its 
antiquity. The organ is the 
Hook & Hastings pattern, made 
about 1S37.

Sisters of Mercy from Clavenck 
St. Average number of pupils 
about 60. 

St. Stephen's Church, 
George St., near Brown, is a fine 
specimen of Gothic architecture, 
with rough gray stone walls, 
largely covered with English ivy. 
Important features of the interior 
are its stone pillars, fine stained- 
glass windows, and a handsome 
brass tablet memorial of the late 
Henry Waterman, D. D., a former 
rector. The church was conse- 
crated in 1862, having removed 
in that vear from what is now 
the Church of the Saviour. The 
organ was made by Hook & ( 
Hastings in 1S56. 

Sacred Heart, The Female 
Academy of the, Smith St., 
opp. Elmhurst Av., incorp. 1873, 
is a large boarding-school con- | 
ducted by ladies of the Roman- 
Catholic Order of the Sacred ;

Bryant & Stratton's ; several Eng- 
lish and classical schools, includ- 
ing Mowry & Goff's (noticed else- 
where), J. P. C. Shaw's, and the 
University Grammar School ; 
Miss J. L. Abbott's school for 
girls, and Mrs. Fielden and Miss 
Chace's school for girls, and 
Mrs. C. M. N. Aldens kinder-

State Normal School, Rhode- 
Island School for the Deaf, Mt. 
Pleasant Academy, Berlitz School 
of Languages, Providence Con- 
servatory of Music, School of 
Elocution, La Salle Academy, 
St. Francis Xavier Academy, 
Sacred Heart Seminary, Soci- 
ety of Friends School, and sev- 
eral Roman-Catholic parochial 
schools. In addition to these is 



the public-school system, regard- 
ing which some statistics are given 
below. 

Schools (Public).  A free 
public-school system was inaug- 
urated in 1800, when 4 school - 
houses were opened, and attended 
by nearly 1,000 pupils. In 18S2 
there are 85 schools, with about 
13,000 pupils. The city is divided 
into 7 school-districts, and the 
scholars are distributed among 
the various grades nearly as fol- 
lows : in the high school, 500 
pupils; in 11 grammar schools, 
3,700 ; in 35 intermediate schools, 
3,300 ; and in 38 primary schools, 
5,600 pupils. Nine evening 
schools are maintained during 
the winter, with an attendance of 
about 2,000 scholars. The upper 
grade schools have separate build- 
ings ; but the primary and inter- 
mediate grades occupy, as a rule, 
the same building, making the 
number of structures in actual 
use 49, beside which are two or 
three old buildings now disused. 
A new edifice is now in process 
of completion. 

The school-buildings are gener- 
ally well adapted to their purposes, 
and some are elegant and costly. 
The High School and the Point- 
st. Grammar School are magnifi- 
cent specimens of their class ; and 
the Doyle-av., Federal-st, and 
Thayer-st. Grammar Schools, and 
a few others, are also fine archi- 
tectural structures. There are 
2S3 teachers, whose salaries range 
from $350 to $2,100. The aver- 
age public-school course is 12 
years. The management of the 
public schools is in the hands of 
a school-committee, composed of 
6 members from each ward, two 
of whom are chosen annually by 
the electors of their respective 



KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 101 



wards for a term of three years. 
The general oversight and direc- 
tion of teachers and pupils is 
intrusted to the sup't of public 
schools, and the care of the 
buildings to the sup't of public 
buildings. The total expenditure 
for the year ending Sept. 30, iSSi, 
was $198,507.14 for general ex- 
penses and salaries ; and $25,833,- 
30 for schoolhouses and lands. 
Daniel Leach has been the sup't 
of public schools ever since Feb., 
1855. 

Seamen's Friend Society, 
The Providence, was formed in 
1S41, to furnish religious instruc- 
tion to seamen. It supports and 
controls the management of the 
Seamen's Bethel, distributes re- 
ligious papers aboard vessels, 
and by other means accomplishes 
its purpose. 

Seekonk (misspelled " See- 
khouk") River rises nearWorces- 
ter, Mass., and enters Providence 
Harbor at India Point. It is 
known at Pawtucket as the Paw- 
tucket River, and above Paw- 
tucket as the Blackstone. Where 
it washes the city shores, it is 
broad and beautiful. In the city 
limits it is crossed by three 
bridges,  Central, Washington, 
and the Providence, Warren, and 
Bristol R. R. bridge,  and is 
navigable to Pawtucket, 4 miles. 
The Brown University boat- 
house is on the river, near Cen- 
tral Bridge. 

Seekhouk, the spelling given to 
the name Seekonk River, by John 
Howard Hinton in his History of 
the United States. See Seekonk 
River. 

September Gale.  In 1815 
occurred one of the most impor- 
tant events in the history of the 



State,  the "Great September 
Gale," a terrible storm, commen- 
cing Sept. 22, and reaching the 
height of its fury on the 23d. 
Previous to the gale, the atmos- 
phere became very hot, and the 
clouds settled remarkably low. 
As the storm increased, the water 
from the harbor was driven in, 
and rose some 10 or 12 ft. above 
its usual height. Many of the 
business sts. were flooded to a 
considerable depth, blockading 
stores and houses in the vicinity. 
Some of the smaller sailing-craft 
were thrown into the Cove  
then of much larger dimensions 
 or forced into the streets. 
Great damage was done both to 
private and public property, 
though in this terrible wreck but 
two persons were lost. Such was 
the fury of the storm, that salt 
spray was thrown inland some 
40 miles. 

In 1869 occurred the second 
" September Gale " Though of 
much shorter duration, it was 
thought to be as severe as its pre- 
decessor, and, had it been pro- 
longed, would have been equally 
disastrous in its results. As it 
was, much property was destroyed, 
large trees were uprooted, 
wharves and streets were flooded, 
cellars and stores submerged.

Sewerage.  The present sys- 
tem of sewerage was devised by 
J. Herbert Shedd, and adopted 
by the city in 1872. Up to the 
present time about 44^ miles of 
pipe have been laid. In the Tenth 
Ward and a large part of the Ninth 
no sewers have, as yet, been in- 
troduced. The rest of the city is 



102 KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 



divided into 12 districts, named 
from the streets in which the 
principal mains are placed. On 
the East Side, E. of Prospect 
Hill, the sewage is conducted 
to the Seekonk River and the 
harbor through the Brook-st., 
Ives-st, and Pitman-st. sewers; 
the north portion is drained by the 
Lippitt-st. sewer, emptying into 
the Moshassuck River ; the sew- 
ers in North and South Main Sts. 
empty into the Providence River. 
The drainage of the West Side is 
all in one general direction, 
towards the Providence River. 
The Charles-st. sewer conducts 
to the Moshassuck River ; the 
Dorrance, Pearl, Eddy and Point 
sts. sewers, directly to the Provi- 
dence River; and a lateral or in- 
tercepting sewer, built to relieve 
the pressure upon the 4 last- 
named, empties into the harbor. 
The sewers range in size from 12 
to 66 in. diameter, circular con- 
struction, and from 16 x 24 to 
66 x 72 oval construction. For 
the fiscal year 18S0-81 the total 
cost of sewer construction was 
$10,913.16; and of maintenance, 
$16,442.35. 

" Shelter," The, 20 Olive St., 
(East Side) receives chil- 
dren between the ages of 3 and 1 2 
years, who are deprived by death 
of one or both parents, or are ex- 
posed to evil parental influence. 
Respectable parents living out 
at service may place their chil- 
dren in the institution as boarders. 
The " Shelter " is managed by 
the Prov. Ass'n for the Benefit 
of Children, formed 
in 183S, which in 1839 secured a 
small dwelling on North Main St., 
and in the face of violent preju- 
dice opened a home for the care 
of the two children then under its 



charge, and such others as might 
come to it. By 1849 the society 
had won friends enough to enable 
it to commence the erection of 
the present plain but comfortable 
edifice, upon land previously do- 
nated by Mrs. Maria Jenkins, and 
thus to meet its want of increased 
as well as of better accommoda- 
tions. Visitors admitted daily, 
except Sundays. Brook-st. H. c. 

Shoo -Fly Village is the 
euphonious name applied to 
Eiswald St., a short street in the 
Eighth Ward, adjacent to the 
N. Y., P. and B., N. Y. and N. E., 
and P. and Sp. R. R. tracks, 
which here run parallel. 

Signal Service.  The U. S. 
Government maintains no signal- 
station in Providence ; but, by an 
arrangement with the War De- 
partment, storm-signals are dis- 
played in the daytime, when re- 
quired, from the Journal and 
Bulletin flagstaff. They consist 
of a " danger or storm signal,"   
a red flag, white centre,  used 
when indications are received of 
an approaching storm, accom- 
panied by a wind with a velocity 
exceeding 20 miles an hour ; and 
the " cautionary or off - shore 
signal,"  a white flag, black 
centre, placed over the red flag, 
 used when the wind is expected 
to blow from the land to the 
ocean with a velocity which would 
be perilous to navigation.

Smith's Hill is a steep ele- 
vation north of the Cove. It 
reaches its highest altitude, So 
feet, near the cor. of Smith and 
Carroll Sts. It commands a 
good view of the city. There 
are several fine estates upon this 
eminence. 

Socialistic Labor Party, 
Providence Section of the, 
was org^d Feb. 22, 1SS1. This 
party has a national org'n, and 
has for its objects, "that the 
sources of life viz., land, the 
means of production, public trans- 
portation and exchange  become 
the property of the whole people," 
and is also in favor of universal 
suffrage. The Providence section 
holds monthly meetings, and has 
a membership of about 60. Philip 
J. Murphy, organizer; Frank

Societa di Unione e Benevo- 
lenza Italiana.Di Providence, 
R.I., is composed of Italian resi- 
dents of Providence. It was found- 
ed Jan. 8, 1SS1; incorporated by 
the General Assembly, March 30, 
1882. Its object is to aid mem- 
bers in case of sickness or misfor- 
tune. 

Society for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Animals, Rhode 
Island, org. in 1870, is a pros- 
perous association, and, by its 
careful surveillance and punish- 
ment of offences, has done much 
to prevent ill-treatment and neg- 
lect of dumb animals. The 
Ladies' Auxiliary of this society, 
org. in 1872, aids the cause by 
various enterprises for raising 
funds ; and has contributed to 



for best compositions on this 
and kindred subjects. Rev. 
Frederic Denison, sec'y and gen'l 
agent. 

Sockanosset Reservoir, on 
Sockanosset Hill, in the town of 
Cranston, 6 miles from Provi- 
dence, 1 mile from Pettaconset 
pumping - station, covers about 
14 acres, and has a capacity of 
over 51,000,000 gallons. A brick 
conduit, passing through the 
embankment, connects the inlet 
and outlet chambers, independent 
of the reservoir.. The building of 
this reservoir was begun May 3, 
1S70. Water was firstTintroduced 
into the city Nov. 30, 1S71. See 
Water- Works. 

Soldiers' and Sailors' His- 
torical Society of Rhode 
Island was incorp. in 1S75, to 
collect and preserve mementos, 
relics, and a true historv of the 
War of the Rebellion. All hon- 
orably discharged soldiers and 
sailors of the war, and their 
sons, are eligible to member- 
ship. Monthly meetings are held, 
at which original papers, relating 
to personal experiences during 
the war, are read by members, 
and a copy of each, after publi- 
cation by the society, placed in 
the archives. A cabinet of tro- 
phies and other articles connected 
with the history of the war is 
owned by the society, and a library 
has been begun. Win. F. Hutch- 
inson, M.D., sec'y. 

Soldiers' and Sailors' Mon- 
ument, Exchange Place, erected 
by the State to the memory of 
the officers and men who fell in 
the War of the Rebellion. A 
statue of America (America mili 



rouse an additional interest in tant), 10 feet high, stands upon a 
the subject, by awarding prizes ' pedestal 32 feet above the ground.

The figure rests upon a sword, 
and with the right hand extends a 
wreath of laurels. In the left 
she holds a wreath of immor- 
telles. Below, upon projecting 
abutments at each corner, stand 
statues representing the infantry, 
cavalry, artillery, and naval ser- 
vice. On the panels of the abut- 
ments is the "roll of honor," and 
between the projections are bas- 
reliefs typifying War, Victory, 
Peace, and 'History. The plat- 
form of the base is reached by a 
flight of five steps, broken at each 
corner by pedestals bearing mor- 
tars and mortar-balls. The stat- 
ues, tablets, etc., are of bronze. 
The monument is of granite, and 
stands in a small grass-plat en- 
closed by a handsome fence of 
granite and iron. Dedicated Sept. 
16, 1S71. Cost $60,000. Sculp- 
tor, Randolph Rogers, who had 
the designs cast in Munich. 

Sons of Jonadab is a na- 
tional secret temp, org., with two 
"Councils" in Providence,  the 
Washington No. 2, and the South 
Providence No. 3. The mem- 
bers take an "iron-clad" oath 
for life not to use any liquors 
whatever. A member once 
breaking his oath is expelled 
without recourse. It is a flourish- 
ing org. in the Southern States. 

Sophia - Little Temporary- 
Home, Broad near Eddy St., 
provides a temporary home for 
women discharged from the penal 
institutions of the State. It re- 
ceives women who show a desire 
for reformation, and affords a 
shelter from all vicious influences 
until an opportunity is presented 
for starting afresh upon a better 
path of life. The work of the 
house is done by the inmates, 



who also maintain a laundry. 
The temporary character of the 
Home renders it dependent al- 
most wholly upon donations for 
support. It was opened May 6, 
188 1, occupies a brick building 
formerly a hotel, and is managed 
by The Prisoners' Aid Ass'n 
(which see). The Home is the 
result of the untiring efforts of 
Mrs. Sophia Little, in whose 
honor it has been named.

South Providence designates 
that portion of the Ninth "Ward 
lying bet. Broad St. and the har- 
bor. Formerly in the town of 
Cranston, it was annexed to the 
city, together with Elmwood, in 
1S6S. It is chiefly a place of resi- 
dence. Field's Point is in the 
extreme south-eastern part of this 
district. 

Squantum Club, incorporated 
March 13, 1872, composed of 
Rhode -Island gentlemen, is an 
ass'n for culture and recreation. 
Its capital stock is not to exceed 
$15,000, to be divided into shares 
of $100 each. It owns a club- 
house and other buildings at 
Squantum, a rocky promontory 
almost opposite Field's Point, 
about ten miles below the city, on 
the eastern shore of Narragansett 
Bay. The buildings are gayly 
painted, and with the ruggedness 
of the natural surroundings pre- 
sent a very picturesque appear- 
ance to the traveller on the bay. 
The club originated with a num- 
ber of Rhode - Islanders, who 
were wont to enjoy an old- 
fashioned clam-bake among the 
rocks at Squantum. And now 
during the season clam-bakes are 
indulged in about once a week ; 



KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 



and on Saturdays in the middle of 
the months, ladies are invited. 
Only stockholders are entitled to 
the privileges of the club. In- 
vited guests are paid for by those 
who invite them. Many distin- 
guished people have been the 
guests of the club : among them 
was President Arthur in his visit 
to the city in Oct. 1882. Shubael 
JI. Cady is pres't, and F. M. 
Burroughs is sec'y. 

Squaw Hollow is the name 
given to a district bet. Orms and 
Martin Sts. and adjacent to Bull- 
dog Hill. It was formerly inhab- 
ited almost wholly by and 
a low class of white people. The 
introduction of a horse-car route 
in this section of the city, and the 
building of a better class of 
dwellings in the vicinity, are fast 
changing the character of the 
locality. 

Stages.  See Omnibuses and 
Stages. 

Stampers Hill is a bluff W. 
of Stampers St., and derives its 
name, according to tradition, 
from an event which occurred 
soon after the settlement of Prov- 
idence. A body of Indians were 
seen approaching the town with 
evidently hostile intentions. Some 
of the townspeople, by running 
and stamping on this hill, pro- 
duced the impression that a large 
force was stationed there, where- 
upon the enemy retired without 
making an attack. Previous to 
the burning of the town by the 
Indians in 1676, this hill was for- 
tified. 

State Farm, The, in the town 
of Cranston, 6 miles from Provi- 
dence, 421 acres in extent, was 
purchased in 1S69. The build- 
ings upon it comprise a State 



house of correction, State work- 
house, State asylum for the in- 
curable insane, and a State al ins- 
house. These are ornamental 
structures of stone, supplied with 
water and gas, and well adapted 
to their respective requirements. 
Reached by the Pawtuxet Valley 
branch of the N.-Y., Prov., & 
Boston R. R. 

State House, on the site of 
the Old-Colony House (burnt in 
175S), occupies an entire sq. bet. 
Benefit and North Main Sts. It 
was built in 1762, and is a plain 
two-story building of painted 
brick with stone facings, sur- 
mounted by a belfry. It was 
used as both Court and State 
House until 1S77, when the 
Courts were removed to the new 
house on College St. In 1881 
the interior was remodelled and 
handsomely fitted up. The first 
floor contains the Hall of Repre- 
sentatives ; the second, the Senate 
Chamber, office of the sec'y of 
state, State library, and govern- 
or's room. Among interesting 
relics of the past, may be seen 
here a collection of battle-flags, 
24 State flags, 35 guidons, and 2 
Revolutionary standards, repre- 
senting all the military organiza- 
tions of the State, excepting the 
Ninth and Tenth Infantry regi- 
ments. Portraits in oil of ex-gov- 
ernors and other notables adorn 
the rooms. In the Sec'y of State's 
room is a portrait of Washington 
by Gilbert Stuart ; here also may 
be seen the "Gaspee" commis- 
sion, the State Charter of 1663, 
 in force until 1S42,  and the 
deed of the State House lot.

State Normal School, The, 
was opened Sept. 6, 187 1, at 265 
High St., near Dean. On the re- 
moval of the High School in 
1S7S to its present building, the 
Normal School took possession 
of the old High School building 
on Benefit St., bet. Angell and 
Waterman Sts. It is a training- 
school for teachers, and requires 
examinations from all candidates 
for admission, excepting High 
School graduates. J. C. Green-

State Reform School, The, 
Tockwotton St., cor. East, as the 
name implies, is a school of ref- 
ormation, where minors sentenced 
by the courts, together with those 
intrusted to it by parents or 
guardians, are instructed in vir- 
tue and morality, the common 



branches of learning, and some 
useful kind of labor. There are 
two buildings : the main building 
of brick, painted white, with a 
fine portico on two sides in the 
Doric style, and containing the 
dormitories, chapel, library, din- 
ing-room, etc. ; and a brick struc- 
ture in the rear, used as a work- 
shop. The buildings (with the 
exception of the workshop) were 
formerly the Tockwotton Hotel. 
The property was purchased by 
the city in 1S50, and held by it 
until July 1, 18S0, when it was 
transferred to the State. The 
inmates average 190 (170 boys 
and 20 girls), and the system of 
management is known ' as the 
" congregate." Visitors admitted 
from 9 A.M. to 4 p.m. Govemor- 
st. H. C. In the winter of 1882, the 
Reform School will be removed 
to a site near the other State in- 
stitutions in Cranston, where two 
cottages for the boys, one for the 
girls, a workshop, and a superin- 
tendent's house, all of stone, 
have been erected at an expense 
of about $110,000. Here the 
" open " or family system will 
probably be adopted.

Stone & Carpenter have 
been the architects and builders 
of many of the finest buildings in 
the State. These buildings, by 
reason of their number and va- 
riety, show tor themselves the ver- 
satile talent, ripened experience, 
and excellent judgment of the 
members of the firm ; which is 
composed of Alfred Stone, who 
came as an architect to Provi- 
dence in 1S64, and Charles E. 
Carpenter, who became associated 
with him in 1873. Among their 
many buildings may be mentioned 
the following .- Public Buildings. 

 Rhode - Island State Prison, 
Providence-County Court House,

Amasa Mason Block ; Barnaby 
Building; Congdon, Carpenter, & 
Co.'s warehouse ; Owen Building; 
Wood's Building; Cheapside ; 
Tefft Block. Of Diodiings the 
firm have a great number ; notably 
those of Henry W. Gardiner on 
Waterman St., Mrs. Esther H. 
Baker on Hope St., Walter Rich- 
mond on Waterman St., F. W. 
Goddard on George St., J. B. 
Barnabyon Broadway, Gen. Am- 
brose E. Burnside on Benefit St., 
Benjamin F. Thurston on Water- 
man St., Samuel R. Dorrance on 
Prospect St., Walter J. Comstock 
on Parkis Av., Amos D. Lock- 
wood on Waterman St. ; and of 
Blocks of Dwellings they were ar- 
chitects of St. Stephen's Row on 
George St., Mason Block on 
Aborn St., and Knowles Block 
on Greene St. Two of their 
smaller unique structures are the 
Kindergarten on Angell St., and 
Passenger-Shelter at Roger Wil- 
liams Park. The above list of 
structures designed and built 
by Stone & Carpenter suffices to 
show their prominence as archi- 
tects ; but it is by no means a 
catalogue of their work, merely an 
indication of their successful in- 
dustry during the past twenty 
years. They have been progress- 
ive all the time, constantly 
keeping pace with all worthy 
improvements. The passenger- 
elevator now in such common 
use, they introduced into this 
city, by putting one into the 
Wheaton & Anthony Building, 
65 Westminster St., where they 
have had their office since 1S72. 

Street - Lighting.  Gas is 
used for illuminating purposes 
throughout the city, and also for 
the main thoroughfares in the 
remote districts. Upon the less- 



frecpjented streets of these dis- 
tricts, naphtha lamps are em- 
ployed. There are nearly 4,400 
lights in use in the city, a little 
over a third of which 'are fluid. 
The system of lamp-lighting is 
regulated by the moon, whose 
light is utilized as much as pos- 
sible. This brings the time of 
lighting and extinguishing the 
lamps at different hours, except 
when the moon is invisible. If 
the sky be clouded on full-moon 
nights, a flag displayed from the 
staff on Prospect Terrace is the 
signal to light. By an arrange- 
ment with the R. I. Electric Light 
Co., a six-months test is being 
made of the electric light ; ten 
arc lamps being distributed for 
this purpose upon the lower por- 
tion of Westminster St., and on 
Market Square. 

Streets.  There are over 
1,000 streets in Providence, most 
of them well paved and lighted. 
The principal business streets 
are Westminster, Weybosset, 
High, Broad, North Main St., 
and a part of South Main St. 
Custom House St. presents a 
fine array of solid commercial 
blocks. Dorrance is a fine, broad 
street. On the East Side, Bene- 
fit, Hope, Cooke, and their in- 
tersecting streets contain many 
beautiful private residences. On 
the West Side, Elmwood, parts of 
Cranston, High, and Washington 
Sts., and Broadway, are very at- 
tractive. In the Tenth Ward, on 
Chalkstone Av. and Smith St., 
are some fine estates. Many of 
the streets have curious names, 
some of Indian origin. Some of 
special interest are mentioned 
elsewhere. A noticeable feature 
is their cleanliness. Under di- 
rection of the Board of Public

Works, the main thoroughfares 
are swept and washed, and nearly 
all the streets are kept in good 
condition. They are generally 
narrow, and rather irregularly 
laid out; some, too, are quite 
crooked. The chief streets in 
the centre of the city radiate 
from Market Sq.

Suffrage.  Foreign-born citi- 
zens are required by the constitu- 
tion of Rhode Island to be pos- 
sessed of real estate taxed for at 
least $134, to entitle them to vote. 
Native-born citizens who are not 
taxed for $1.34, of either real or 
personal property, cannot vote 
in any town or city, on any ques- 
tion involving the expenditure of 
money or the imposition of a tax, 
nor in the city of Providence for 
members of the city council. Such 
native-born citizens, if they wish 
to vote, are required to register 
their names with the city or town 
clerk on or before the last day of 
December, in the year next pre- 
ceding the time of voting, and to 
pay $1 as a registry-tax. An or- 
ganization known as the Equal 
Rights Association, having for its 
objects the repeal of the property 
qualification, and the procuring of 
equal rights for all men in a polit- 
ical sense, was formed in the 
spring of 1SS1, and, with this end 
in view, has since then carried on 
an agitation by means of public 
meetings, addresses, petitions to 
the General Assembly, etc. The 
main organization h in Provi- 
dence, and there are branches in 
Pawtucket, Newport, and several 
of the towns. The membership 
is not large, and the movement 



appears to meet with but little 
favor. 

Superintendent of Health 
is the advisory and executive 
officer of the Board of Health. 
It is his duty to investigate and 
report upon nuisances and all 
other matters connected with the 
public health. He is also quar- 
antine health-officer for the city. 
Dr. Edwin M. Snow has filled 
this position for the past 26 years, 
and the position of city regis- 
trar (of births, marriages, and 
deaths) for the past 27 years.

The first line of telegraph from 
Providence was run in 1848, to 
Worcester, Mass., to connect with 
the line of the New- York & Bos- 
ton Telegraph Association. This 
was 4 years after Mor>e had built 
the first telegraph-line in the 
United States. 

Telephone Company.  Two 
telephone exchanges were estab- 
lished in Providence in 1878, one 
under Western Union, the other 
under Bell Telephone, manage- 
ment. After the consolidation of 
the two great i nterests represented 
by these exchanges, they became 
in the winter of 1S79 one corpora- 
tion, under the name of the Provi- 
dence Telephone Co. The head- 
quarters of this company are in 
Butler Exchange, 103 Westmin- 
ster St. It controls over 1,000 
miles of wire in the city, main- 
tains lines to nearly every impor- 
tant town in the State, and also 
operates the line of the Inter- 
State Co. to Boston. It also 
holds communication with Fall 
River, New Bedford, and other 
places. The company makes 
over 2,100 connections, about 
two-thirds of which are in the 
city. Public telephones are sta- 
tioned in the following places : C. 
G. A. Peterson's, ground floor, 
Butler Exchange ; William R. 
Greene's apothecary - store. 1 
Westminster St. ; H. J. Alfred's, 
Si 1 Eddy St.; and at the Base 
Ball Grounds,  for the use of 
which non-subscribers are charged 
15 cts. within the city limits, 25 
cts. to all other points within the 
company's territory. Subscribers 
also must pay at all but the first 
mentioned station. 



Temperance Organizations. 
 There are in Providence 2 
lodges of I. O. of Good Tem- 
plars, with a membership of about 
200, G. Sec'y, J. N. Todd; 5 
divisions of Sons of Temperance, 
with 316 members, G. Scribe, 
Mrs. J. H. Scholfield ; 3 Tem- 
ples of Honor, numbering 151 
members, G. W. R., J. C. Lester; 
and 2 Councils of Sons of Jona- 
dab. All these organizations 
hold weekly meetings in their 
separate halls, which are scattered 
in various portions of the city. 
The Providence Reform -Club, 
comprising over 500 members, 
also holds weekly meetings. 
Sec'y, E. W. Boynton. Other 
temperance associations having 
their headquarters in this city are 
the Rhode - Island Temperance 
Union, Cor. Sec'y, Rev. H. 
W. Conant ; Women's Christian 
Temperance Union of Rhode 
Island, Cor. Sec'y, Mrs. E. S. 
Burlingame ; Women's Christian 
Temperance Union of Provi- 
dence, Cor. Sec'y, Miss L. W. 
Thompson ; State Temperance

Tenth Ward lies in the north- 
western part of the city, N. of the 
Woonasquatucket and W. of the 
Moshashuck rivers. It is mostly 
an extensive and undulating farm- 
ing region, but, on the whole, 
sparsely populated. Smith's Hill, 
Mt. Pleasant, and several small 
manufacturing villages, as Dyer- 
ville, Geneva, Wanskuck, are in 
this district. 

Theatres.  Isaiah Thomas, 
in his " History of Printing," 
says that the first play publicly 



KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 



performed in New England was 
acted in Providence in 1762. But 
Charles Blake, in his elaborate 
" History of the Providence 
Stage," says this is an erroneous 
statement. He maintains that 
the first theatrical performance 
took place in Newport in 1761, 
when the Virginia comedians ap- 
peared there ; and the next year 
the same troupe appeared in 
Providence, and gave the first 
theatrical performance ever given 
in this city. In 1795 the first 
theatre was erected at the cor. of 
Westminster and Mathewson Sts., 
which was occupied until 1832, 
and then converted into what is 
now known as Grace Church. A 
second theatre was erected in 
1839, but, proving unprofitable, 
was abandoned to business pur- 
poses. This building is still 
standing at 89 Dorrance St., 
nearly opposite the Providence 
Opera House. See Places of 
Amusement. 

Theatre Comique, S3 Wey- 
bosset St., is a small theatre, re- 
modelled and re-furnished in 
1 88 1. The performances are 
chiefly of the "variety" class. 

Tibbitts, Shaw, & Co., the 
leading and longest-established 
house "in the bookselling and sta- 
tionery trade, occupy a site 
which for upwards of half a 
century has been occupied for 
the same business. Before the 
estuary of the Narragansett was 
solidly built over at the present 
Market Sq., before the Union 
Depot was the centripetal horse- 
car point of the city, and before 
the " Cove" was the focus ground 
of the N. S. and W. railway lines, 
a three-story wooden dwelling 
stood on the site of Tibbitts, Shaw, 



& Co.'s store, at No. 21 Westmin- 
ster St., near Market Sq. The 
lower part of this dwelling was 
submerged in 1S17 by the waters 
of Narragansett Bay, driven back 
by the gale of that year. In 1S30 
the dwelling began to be utilized 
as the bookstore, printing-office, 
and bindery of Wm. Marshall & 
Co. In 1836 John B. Gough, 
then a long and lank youth of 19 
years, came from Bristol, R. I., 
where he had been apprenticed 
to a man he describes as "sexton 
of a meeting-house, sawer of 
wood, had a bookbindery, and 
kept boiled eggs to sell." He 
went to work in Marshall's bind- 
ery, and, as an English biogra- 
pher has said, "learned the trade 
of bookbinder, and fell into the 
habits of intemperance." Even 
at that early date he displayed 
great oratorical ability. While 
he himself kept at work, he 
mimicked men and narrated 
events so graphically and so 
dramatically that his employers 
often caught the other workmen 
neglecting their work to listen to 
him. In 1S40 the wooden build- 
ing was moved to Dorrance St., 
where it is still used for business 
purposes. On its site stands a 
plain, substantial, four-story 
brick building, which has always 
been occupied by a line of suc- 
cessful and highly trustworthy 
booksellers, stationers, and bind- 
ers. In 1S30 the firm was Wm. 
Marshall & Co.; in 1837 Mr. 
Marshall retired, and was suc- 
ceeded by his partner, John 
Edwin Brown, who, in 183S, sold 
out to Isaac II. Cady, who asso- 
ciated with him Mr. Brown's 
brother, William Brown. In 1842 
the business came into possession 
of Gladding & Proud, whose sue-

cessors have been successively, 
Gladding Brothers, Gladding 
Brothers & Co., Gladding Broth- 
ers & Tibbits, Tibbitts& Randall, 
Tibbitts & Shaw ; and finally the 
present firm, Tibbitts, Shaw, & 
Co., composed of Wm. T. Tib- 
bitts, Joseph A. Shaw, and W. B. 
Swarts, who may well be proud 
of their business ancestors, and 
be well pleased with the extensive 
patronage which they now enjoy. 

Tillinghast House is an an- 
cient landmark standing on South 
Main St., just N. of Transit St. 
It was built by Philip Tillinghast, 
probably about 1710; and, when 
erected, was one of the only 3 or 
4 dwelling-houses in that part of 
the town. It is a wooden house, 
two stories high, with western 
basements, a hipped roof, dor- 
mer windows, and an immense 
chimney in the centre, 5 ft. sq. at 
the top. 

Time.  Providence time is 1 
min. and 22 sees, behind Boston 
time. One stroke of the electric 
fire-alarm is struck at 12 M. and 
8.30 p. m. automatically from the 
clock in the City Hall, and gives 
in each case Providence time as 
corrected by Boston time, tele- 
graphed from the Harvard Ob- 
servatory at Cambridge.

Trinity Methodist Episcopal 
Church is a handsome brick edi- 
fice on Broad St., near Bridgham. 
The society was org'd under its 
present name, April 24, 1859, but 
had a short time previous been 
begun as a mission of the Math- 
ewson-st. Church. Services were 
held in Lester Hall on Cranston 
St., until the completion of the 
present edifice in 1865. Present

Union American Methodist 
Episcopal Church, L. 
V. St., was org'd in 1874, and 
incorp'd June 1, 1882. The pres-

Union Congregation al 
Church on Broad St. neat- 
Stewart St., completed in 1872, is 
a fine brick edifice in Gothic 
style, designed by Wm. R. 
Walker. Its trimmings are of 
stone. It has two towers or 
steeples of unequal height. Its 
interior is handsomely finished, 
and the seats are arranged as in 
an amphitheatre. The society 
worshipping here was formed by 
the union of the Richmond-st. 
and High - st. Congregational 
Churches in 1S71. In the rear of 
the church is a chapel, similar in 
architecture, used for Sunday- 
school purposes. 

Union for Christian Work, 
occupying pleasant quarters at 
135 Broad St., is a benevolent 
organization, asking only, as a 
qualification for membership, "a 



sincere desire to do good and help 
men upwards." The active mem- 
bers pay $1 a year, and carry 
on the work. Fine members pay 
not less than $5 a year, and 
may vote for officers, but need not 
take active part in the work. The 
rooms comprise a reading-room 
and a library of 3,000 vols. These 
are free to all, week-days from 4 
to 10 p. M. ; and the reading-room 
is open Sundays from 2 to 5 and 
7 to 9 p. m. A room open Satur- 
day nights during the winter 
months furnishes to street-boys 
books, games, and kind influ- 
ences. The Union also main- 
tains three branch-rooms for this 
purpose in other sections of the 
city. A Flower Mission collects 
and distributes on Saturdays 
flowers to the sick and infirm, in 
the hospital, the homes for aged 
men and women, etc.

Unitarian Denomination is 
represented in Providence by 
three churches,  the First Con- 
gregational, the Westminster 
Congregational, and the Olney- 
st. Congregational. The First 
Congregational was formed in 
1720, not without an earnest 
protest on the part of leading 
members of the Baptist Church. 
In 1721 the erection of a house 
of worship was begun on High 
St., but the edifice was torn down 
when in an unfinished state. In 
1723 another house was built, on 
the cor. of College and Benefit 
Sts., which in 1794 was sold to the 
town for a town-house. In 1794-95 
a fine church edifice was built on 
the cor. of Benefit and Benevolent 
Sts., which was burnt June 14, 
1814. In 1S15-16, the spacious

and elegant structure now occu- 
pied by the society was erected, 
being dedicated Oct. 31, 1816. 
The pastors have been Josiah 
Cotton, 172S-1747 ; John Bass, 
[752-1758 ; David S. Rowland, 



1761-1774 



Enos Hitchcock, 



17S3-1803 ; Henry Edes, 1805-

1S71; Carlton Albert Staples, 
1872-188 1 ; Thomas Roberts 
Slicer, 1SS1, now filling the pas- 
torate. 

The Westminster Congrega- 
tional was org'd in 1828. A 
church edifice was built in 1829, 
on Mathewson St., near West- 
minster St., and is still occupied 
by the society. The pastors have 
been Frederic Augustus Farley, 
1828-1841; Samuel Osgood, 1S41- 
1849 ; Frederic Henry Hedge, 
1S50-1S56; Augustus Woodbury, 
1S57, who is the present in- 
cumbent. 

The Olney-st. Congregational 
grew out of the Benefit-st. Min- 
istry at Large, which was org'd 
in 1S41. A chapel was built on 
the cor. of Benefit and Halsey 
Sts. in 1846. A more commo- 
dious and larger edifice was built 
on Olney St. in 1871. The Min- 
istry at Large has been mainly 
supported by the members of the 
First Society and the Westmin- 
ster Society, and its ministers 
have been Henry Francis Har- 
rington, 1S42-1S44 ; William 
Gustavus Babcock, 1S44-1S47 ; 
Edwin Martin Stone, 1S47-1S77 ; 
Alfred Manchester, 1S7S. In 
iS79the Olney-st. Congregational 
Society was incorporated, and 
Alfred Manchester became its 
pastor. 

The three churches and their 
ministers have labored earnestly 



and faithfully in the illustration 
and enforcement of the principles 
of Liberal Christianity. The 
Ministry at Large still continues 
in existence, supported by the 
Unitarian churches. It has had 
a noble history of beneficent 
Christian work.  Augustus Wood-

Universalists.  The Rev. 
John Murray, the father of Amer- 
ican Universalism, preached fre- 
quently in Providence as early as 
A.D. 1772, and other preachers 
of the denomination held services 
here from time to time. But the 
first society was not incorporated 
until Oct. 1821. Since then this so- 
ciety has had a prosperous exist- 
ence. It occupied two churches 
on Westminster St. before erect- 
ing the spacious building which 
it occupies at the cor. of Greene 
and Washington Sts. The second 
society, known as "The Church 
of the Mediator," was established 
A.D. 1845, and occupies the sub- 
stantial edifice on Cranston St., 
cor. of Burgess St. Besides these 
two parishes there are in Rhode 
Island three Universalist parishes: 
one in Woonsocket, one in Paw- 
tucket, and one in East Provi- 
dence where a new church edifice 
was dedicated Oct. 24, 1882. 
There are Universalist chapels at 
Valley Falls and Cumberland ; 
and for some years a State mis- 
sionary has been maintained, who 
has preached at Burrillville, An-

Vaccination.  The first suc- 
cessful arm-to-arm inoculation 
with the virus of cow-pox, as a 
prevention to infection from small- 
pox, was performed in 1796, by 
Dr. Edward Jenner of Berkeley, 
Gloucester, England. This new 
method of inoculation was soon 
after introduced into this country, 
and was undoubtedly practised, 
in a private way, in Providence. 
A vote passed in town-meeting 
June 9, 1810, furnishes the earli- 
est record of a public vaccination. 
It was voted " that James Burrill, 
jun., Tristam Burgess, Thomas P. 
Ives, John Carlisle, John Markin, 
David Leonard Barnes, and 
\\ heeler Martin, be a committee 
to employ some suitable person 
or persons to inoculate with kine- 
pock such inhabitants of this town 
as may be desirous thereof. That 
said inoculation be conducted 
under the direction of said com- 
mittee, and the expense thereof to 
be paid out of the town treasury." 
Mr. Sylvanus Fransher, "an ex- 
perienced vaccine inoculator," was 
selected to perform this duty; and 
the work of vaccination, com- 
menced July 2, was continued at 
different times and places for six 
weeks. At the close of their 
labors the committee reported 
that 4,305 persons had been vac- 
cinated. From this large propor- 
tion out of a population of but 
10,000 souls, it is evident that but 



IX 5 

little prejudice existed against 
vaccination. Until the year 1856, 
public vaccinations were per- 
formed at irregular intervals ; but 
on April 26, of that year, the 
present system of weekly vaccina- 
tions, performed at the office of 
the Board of Health and free to 
all residents of the city, was in- 
augurated. In the period from 
1S56 to 1SS2, over 26,000 persons 
have availed themselves of this 
means of vaccination. 

The records of the different 
years show a great variation in 
the number vaccinated. This is 
due to partly to the growth of 
population, but more especially 
to the presence or absence, as it 
may happen, of cases of small- 
pox. The largest number vac- 
cinated in any one vear was 2,798 
(in 1S72) ; the smallest, 136 (in 
1S57). There were 1,156 vaccina- 
tions in 1879, 1,343 i n 1880, and 
2,307 in 1881. 

Children attending the public 
schools of this city are required 
to present evidence of having been 
successfully vaccinated. 

Every Saturday (the warm 
summer months alone excepted), 
vaccination is performed at the 
office of Superintendent of Health, 
City Hall, from 2 to 3 p.m.

Walker & Son, Wm. R., are 
among the most prominent and 
most highly esteemed architects 
in Rhode Island ; the senior part- 
ner, Major-Gen. Wm. R. Walker, 
having been, during the past 
twenty consecutive years, the 
architect of a large number of 
notable structures of many kinds. 
It is impossible in this small 
volume to even enumerate the 
buildings constructed under the 
superintendence of this firm ; but 
the following meagre list is am- 
ple enough to indicate their un- 
limited variety, and also to give 
an idea of the ingenuity, expe- 
rience, and judgment which Gen. 
Walker, as a representative ar- 
chitect, must possess. The sev- 
eral classes necessarily require 
wholly different treatment from 
each other, and then only a cas- 
ual glance at the various struc- 
tures in each of the several

Rhode-Island Headquarters at Cen- 
tennial Exposition. 

Sprague Tomb at Swan-Point Ceme- 
tery. 

The above is merely a list of 
some of the notable structures 
which have been erected by this 
firm, which is to-day one of the 
most active in its line in this 
country ; the founder being now in 
the prime of life, the actual as 
well as the nominal head of the 
firm, while his son, Wm. Howard 
Walker, who came into the busi- 
ness eight years ago, and in 1SS0 
acquired a partnership interest, 
is already one of the foremost 
young architects in America. 
The firm's offices occupy the 
larger part of the fourth floor of 
the Vaughan Building, 'No. 27 
Custom House St. They are ad- 
mirably adapted to their uses, and 
thoroughly fitted out with an ex- 
ceptionally fine architect's library, 
models, plans, and other essen- 
tials of a model architect's office. 

Wanskuck, formerly a manu- 
facturing village belonging to the 
town of North Providence, is

Warren Association of Bap- 
tist churches was formed at War- 
ren, R. I., in 1767, and until 1S43 
was the only organization of its 
kind in the State. In that year the 
Providence Association, formed 
of churches that had belonged to 
the Warren Association, was or- 
ganized. In 1S59 the churches in 
the southern part of the State 
separated, and formed the Narra- 
gansett Association. The church- 
es in Providence belonging to the 
Warren Association are, the 



First, Central, Congdon-st., 
Fricndship-st., Union, South, 
and Broadway. The total mem- 
bership of these churches, by re- 
port of 1882, was 2,242 ; this num- 
ber, with total membership of 
churches in Providence, belonging 
to the Providence Association, 
makes the membership of the reg- 
ular Baptist churches for 1S82, 
3,834. The number of churches in 
the Warren Association is 22. 
Yearly anniversaries are held by 
each association. 

Washington Bridge, or In- 
dia Bridge, an old wooden 
structure, the only covered bridge 
for foot-passengers and vehicles 
in the city, crosses the Seekonk 
River at India Point, about  of 
mile below Central Bridge. It is 
said to have derived its name 
from a wooden statue of Wash- 
ington, which adorned a bridge 
built here by John Brown in 1793. 
The bridge and statue were car- 
ried away by a freshet in 1807. 
The present structure has a draw 
38 feet wide, operated by hand. 
A short distance below is a rail- 
road-bridge, also of wood, used 
by the Providence, Warren, and 
Bristol, and the Boston and 
Providence Railroads. 

Washington Square, Benefit, 
cor. India St., is a small grass- 
plat much resorted to by the poor 
people who live near it. It was 
set apart for a public square by 
the Fox - Point Ass'n in 1S16; 
deeded to the city in 1830 ; it 
was graded, fenced, and planted 
in 1S52, and received its present 
title in 1S57. 

Washington Trotting-Park. 
 This race-course, which was in 
a flourishing condition about 40 
years ago, and was in use until 



120 KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 



within 15 years, is now an open 
field on Broad St., near the city 
line. 

Water- Works.  Four times, 
in 1853, 1S56, 1S64, 1S66, attempts 
to supply the city with pure water 
were made, and defeated by the 
popular vote. A committee ap- 
pointed by the Common Council 
in July, 1S66, authorized J. Her- 
bert Shedd, civil engineer, then 
of Boston, to make surveys, and 
present plans and estimates. Mr. 
Shedd's report, made in 1S68, 
treated of four different sources 
of supply ; the most expensive of 
which, the Pawtuxet-river plan, 
was adopted by the tax-payers, 
Feb. 15, 1S69. A Board of Water 
Commissioners was chosen in 
Oct., 1869, and the preparatory 
work of introduction begun at 
once. Water began to flow into 
the city Nov. 18, 1S71 ; and 12 
days later,  Thanksgiving Day, 
 the event was celebrated by 
sending up great jets of water 
from service-pipes conducted to 
the bridges which cross the river. 
The total.cost of construction to 
Sept. 30, 1881, was about $5,100,- 
000; over 160 miles of main pipes 
had been laid. In 18S0 the con- 
trol of the water-works passed 
into the hands of the Board of 
Public Works. See also Hope 
Reservoir, Pawtuxet River, Pavv- 
tuxet Water, Pettaconset Pump- 
ing-Station, and Sockanosset Res- 
ervoir. 

West Burial-ground.  See 
Cemeteries. 

Westminster Congregation- 
al Church (Unitarian), Mathew- 
son St. The church edifice is a 
cement-covered, stone building, 
with a fine portico in the Ionic 
style. Judge Staples in his " An- 



nals of Providence," published in 
1S43, says, "There is no church 
in the city which is more chaste 
in its style of architecture, or 
which exhibits more classic taste 
in its exterior, than this." About 
ten years ago, the interior of the 
building was greatly improved so 
as to carry out the architectural 
design in its completeness. The 
church has had only 4 different 
pastors since its completion in 
1S29. Rev. Augustus Woodbury, 
the present incumbent, has served 
the society since 1857. 

Westminster Street, from 
Great Bridge to High St., five- 
eighths of a mile in length, is the 
main thoroughfare and the centre 
of the retail trade. 

West Side is a natural divis- 
ion, rather than a term in com- 
mon use. It may be considered 
as comprising all that portion of 
the city west of the Providence 
and south of the Woonasqua- 
tucket Rivers. It is the most im- 
portant district, contains nearly 
one-half of the population, and 
embraces the centre of the mer- 
cantile interests. Elmwood, So. 
Providence, and Roger Williams 
Park, are some of the localities, 
and the City Hall, Cathedral, 
High School, and R. I. Hos- 
pital, some of the edifices, in this 
section, mentioned elsewhere.

Great Bridge. 

Wharves.  The principal 
wharves in Providence River and 
Harbor at present are Lonsdale 
Wharf, used by the steamers of 
Providence, Norfolk, and Balti- 
more Line ; Ives' Wharf, used by 
Winsor-Line steamers (these, and 
some others not much used, are 
between India and Fox Points) ;

the pier of the N.Y., P., & B. R.R. 
in S. Providence; the Wilkes- 
barre Coal Pier, E. Providence. 
Between Crawford-st. Bridge and 
Hill's Wharf, on the west side of 
the river, is a series of wharves, 
piers, and docks, at which most 
of the coal, lumber, grain, etc., 
brought to the city in coasting 
vessels, is unloaded. Between 
Crawiord-st. Pridge and Fox 
Point there are no docks, and the 
only important landintj-place is 
the quay of the Fall-River Steam- 
boat Co. In the early history of 
Providence the first wharves were 
on the east side of the river. 
During the last centurv manv 
wharves and docks existed be"- 
tween Town St. and the river, 
by the end of the century the 
docks "north of Crawford St. 
had been filled up, and had be- 
come highwavs." The Sept 
gale of 1815 destroyed many of 
the remaining wharves, and re- 
sulted in the filling-up of the 
docks. Daniel Anthony's map 
of 1803 shows the space now 
bounded by a line drawn from 
the Crawford-st. Bridge through 
Harkness, Pine, Eddy, and Ship 
Sts., to have been a cove. A 
plat dated 1815 shows wharves 
existing in this cove. Until the 
building of the Crawford-st. 
Bridge, and the widening of Dver 
and S. Water Sts., a few years 
ago vessels came up to the Great 
bridge. In 1S77 the project was 
broached of building a sea-wall 
from Hill's Wharf to Sassafras 
Bomt, and then to construct a 
series oi piers running from this 
wall to harbor line. Drawings 
of the proposed improvements 
were made, copies of which may 
be seen in the mayor's office, City 
Hall. As yet no part of the pro- 



ject has been realized except the 
pier of the N.Y., P., & B. R.R. 

"What Cheer, Netop," was 
the friendly salutation with which 
the Indians greeted Roger Wil- 
liams at his first landing upon 
Slate Rock on the bank of the 
Seekonk River. 

What Cheer Square is a 
deep hollow at the cor. of Gano 
and Fremont Sts. It marks the 
first landing-place of Roger Wil- 
liams on our shores. In 1S78 a 
new street was laid out bet. this 
spot and the Seekonk River, and 
the Committee on Parks was 
authorized to raise a portion of 
" Slate Rock,"  so called  until 
the street was brought to a grade. 
This has never been done, and a' 
board fence ten ft. high still pro- 
tects this cherished relic. 



Whipple House on the north 
side of Abbott St., east of North 
Main, is the oldest dwelling in the 
city, dating back more than 200 
years. Its original owner, Samuel 
Whipple, born in 1643, was the first 
person buried in the North Burial- 
Ground. Roger Williams and his 
associates are said to have held 
religious meetings here ; and pos- 
sibly for this reason the building 
was spared by the Indians when 
they burned the town, March 30, 
1676. It is still in good preserva- 
tion, though somewhat altered 
from its original plan. 

Wolfe Tone Guards is an 

Irish-American militia organiza- 
tion, named in honor of Theobald 
Wolfe Tone, the celebrated Irish 
patriot. It is Co. B in the Fifth 
Battalion R. I. militia, and has an 
armory at 54 North Main St. 

Woman's Christian Tem- 
perance Union, aided by be-

nevolent ladies, opened, Feb. 
23, 18S2, the "People's Coffee 
House " at 227 Eddy St. The 
objects are to provide a place 
where workmen and apprentices 
can obtain meals at reasonable 
rates, away from the allurements 
of the rum-shops ; and also to 
feed, clothe, provide work, etc., 
for homeless strangers and poor 
people. The rooms are large and 
well situated for the objects in 
view. The enterprise is sup- 
ported by contributions. Rev. 
Samuel Davis, manager. 

Woman's Foreign Mission- 
ary Society.  The Providence 
Branch of this society, composed 
of the eight M. E. churches and 
the Haven M. E. Church in East 
Providence, pledges a certain an- 
nual sum towards the support of 
the Female Hospital in Bareilly, 
India, and raises a fund for con- 
tingencies, called the Contingent 
Fund. 

Woman's Suffrage Associa- 
tion, The Rhode-Island, holds 
regular monthly meetings at its 
rooms in the Hoppin Homestead 
Building, 2S3 Westminster St. 
Here papers are read and dis- 
cussed, and usually followed by 
an informal tea. Mrs. E. B. 
Chace, pres't ; Mrs. M. J. Chan- 
ning, cor. sec'y. 

Woman's Union Mission- 
ary Society, with its head- 
quarters in New-York City, has 
in Providence a branch, with 100 
members. This association is 
undenominational, and directs its 
efforts to the spiritual improve- 
ment of the women in the East. 
Three American mission homes 
in India  viz., at Calcutta, Alla- 
habad, and Cawnpore  are in 
most successful operation ; and 



special women's work is done in 
Burmah, China, Japan, Syria, 
Greece, and Cyprus. The Provi- 
dence branch was established in 
1870. Miss Emily Waterman, 
pies. ; Miss Mary S. Stockbridge, 
sec. and treas. 

Women's Christian Associ- 
ation and Young Women's 
Boarding Home, org'd in 1S67, 
established in the same year a 
boarding-home for business wo- 
men, where home comforts and 
privileges should be enjoyed at 
moderate rates. This home, in 
1872, was permanently located 
at 66 Fountain St., and is a desir- 
able residence for young women 
desiring to live economically and 
well, and also an agreeable tem- 
porary home for ladies travelling 
alone. In the summer of 1878, 
the ass'n opened a " Seaside Cot- 
tage " at Conanicut Park, on the 
bay, as a resort "for women re- 
quiring rest and change of air, 
unable to pay the high prices of 
hotels and boarding-houses." 
Many a person has gained re- 
newed health and strength here, 
and the institution is worthy of 
liberal support. The ass'n was 
incorporated in 1870, and an act 
passed in 1877 exempts its prop- 
erty from taxation so long as it is 
used for the benevolent purposes 
specified in the charter. 

Women's City Missionary 
Society, an important local char- 
ity, was org'd in 1S67, " to assist 
the poor in efforts to help them- 
selves, and to engage in general 
missionary work in the city." A 
visiting committee is appointed 
for each ward, and all cases are 
carefully investigated ; thus pre- 
venting, to a great extent, impos- 
ture and misapplied aid. During 



KING'S POCKETBOOK OF PROVIDENCE. 123 



the year ending Nov. 14, 1SS1, 
2,0 1 S visits were made, and assist- 
ance rendered to 707 families, 
with an expenditure of nearly 
2,500. The society is supported 
by annual subscriptions and do- 
nations. 

Women's Club, The Rhode- 
Island, established spring of 
1S76, "to form a recognized cen- 
tre for social and mental culture." 
Meetings are held twice a month, 
at Franklin Society Rooms, at 
which scientific and literary pa- 
pers are read, followed occasion- 
ally by discussions. Many repre- 
sentative New-England women, 
as well as eminent gentlemen, 
have addressed the club. Mrs. 
E. K. Churchill was instru- 
mental in its organization. The 
Churchill Memorial lectures were 
established by this society. Pres- 
ent membership, 135. Pres't, 
Miss Sarah E. Doyle ; sec'y, Miss 
L. P. Bucklin. 

Women's Missionary So- 
cieties. Nearly every religious 
denomination has one or more of 
this class.

Woonasquatucket Library, 
Atwell's Av., at junc. of Harris 
Av., has a collection of over 1,600 
well-selected vols., and a reading- 
room supplied with the leading 
periodicals. It is the private 
property of the Richmond 
Manuf. Co., whose print-works 
are in this vicinity, and has 
existed as a reading-room for 
nearly 15 years, as a library for 
about 10 years. It is open every 
week-day evening except Satur- 
day, and from 4 to 6 P. M. on 
Saturdays. Though intended for 



the especial benefit of employees 
of the Richmond Co., residents 
in its neighborhood are allowed 
to enjoy its privileges. The Co. 
reserves the right to forbid its use 
by objectionable persons. 

Woonasquatucket River, 
The, rising in the north-eastern 
part of the State, flows in a 
generally south-westerly direction 
until it enters the "Cove." Early 
in the century, its water-power 
was used to run saw and grist 
mills ; but, on the springing up of 
various small cotton-factories, 
the water supply in the summer 
was found to be insufficient. To 
obviate this serious hinderance to 
business, bet. 1S23 and 1S3S, four 
reservoirswerebuiltforstoringthe 
surplus water until needed. From 
its source to its outlet, it is essen- 
tially a manufacturing stream ; 
and some important manufac- 
tories are along its banks. The 
Providence and Springfield R. R. 
follows its course for several 
miles. 

Work's Gymnasium, 26 
Washington St., open daily from 
9 a. m. to 9 p. M. Visitors ad- 
mitted. 

Yacht-Club,The Providence, 
was org'd in 1875. Thirty-seven 
members were enrolled, and 21 
schooner, sloop, and cat-rigged 
yachts. A club-flag  a red 
triangular pennant, crossed by a 
blue stripe with a white star in 
the centre,  was adopted, a club- 
house built at the foot of Allen's 
Avenue, and for several years 
regattas were regularly held.
