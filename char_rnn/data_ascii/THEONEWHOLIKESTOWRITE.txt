Here in America, in every single state, they have a set of standards for every subject
A collection of lessons that the teachers required to teach by the end of the term
But the greatest lessons youll ever teach us will not come from your syllabus
The greatest lessons you will ever teach us, you will not even remember

You never told us what we werent allowed to say
We just learned how to hold our tongues
Now somewhere in America, there is s a child holding a copy of Catcher in the Rye and there is a child holding a gun

But only one of these things have been banned by their state government
And its not the one that can rip through flesh
Its the one that says fuck you on more pages than one

Because we must control what the people say, and how they think
And if they want to become the overseer of their own selves, then well show them a real one
And somewhere in America, theres a child sitting at his mothers computer, reading the homepage of the KKKs website, and thats open to the public
But that child will never have read To Kill a Mockingbird because the school has banned it for its use of the N word

Maya Angelou is prohibited because were not allowed to talk about rape in school
We were taught that just because something happens, doesnt mean you are to talk about it
They built us brand new shopping malls so that well forget where were really standing
On the bones of the Hispanics, on the bones of the slaves, on the bones of the Native Americans, on the bones of those who fought justice

Speak.

Transcontinental Railroad to Japanese Internment Camps
There are things missing from our history books
But we were taught that it is better to be silent, than to make them uncomfortable
Somewhere in America, private school girls search for hours through boutiques, trying to find the prom dress of their dreams
While kids on the south side spending hours searching through the lost and found cause winters coming soon and thats the only jacket they have

Kids are late to class for working the midnight shift
They give awards for best attendance, but not for keeping your family off the streets
These kids will call your music ghetto, they will tell you you dont talk right
Then theyll get in the backseat of a car with all their friends singing  bout how Theyre bout that life and we cant stop
Somewhere in America, schools are promoting self confidence
While they whip out their scales and shout out your body fat percentage in class

While heftier girls are hiding away, and the slim fit beauties cant help but giggle with pride
The preppy kids go thrift shopping cause they think it sounds real fun
But we dont cause thats all we got money for
Cause momma works for the city, momma only gets paid once a month
Somewhere in America, a girl is getting felt up by a grown man on the subway
Shes still in her school uniform and thats part of the appeal
Its hard to run in knee socks and Mary Janes, and all her male teachers know it too

Coaches cover up the star players raping freshmen after the dance
Women are killed for rejecting dates, but God forbid I bring my girlfriend to prom
Girls black out drunk at the after party, take a picture before her wounds wake her
How many pimples is your sanity worth? Whats a 4.0 to a cold jury?
Whatd you learn in class today?
Dont walk fast, dont speak loud, keep your hands to yourself, keep your head down
Keep your eyes on your own paper, if you dont know the answer, fill in C
Always wear earbuds when you ride the bus alone
If you feel like someones following you, pretend youre on the phone

A teacher never fails, only you do

Every state in America, the greatest lessons, are the ones you dont remember learning
