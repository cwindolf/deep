Whoever closes the wings
of the altar in the Lindenhardt
parish church and locks up
the carved figures in their casing
on the lefthand panel
will be met by St. George.
Foremost at the picture’s edge he stands
above the world by a hand’s breadth
and is about to step over the frame’s
threshold. Georgius Miles,
man with the iron torso, rounded chest
of ore, red-golden hair and silver
feminine features. The face of the unknown
Grünewald emerges again and again
in his work as a witness
to the snow miracle, a hermit
in the desert, a commiserator
in the Munich Mocking of Christ.
Last of all, in the afternoon light
in the Erlangen library, it shines forth
from a self-portrait, sketched out
in heightened white crayon, later destroyed
by an alien hand’s pen and wash,
as that of a painter aged forty
to fifty. Always the same
gentleness, the same burden of grief,
the same irregularity of the eyes, veiled
and sliding sideways down into loneliness.
Grünewald’s face reappears, too,
in a Basel painting by Holbein
the Younger of a crowned female saint.
These were strangely disguised
instances of resemblance, wrote Fraenger
whose books were burned by the fascists.
Indeed it seemed as though in such works of art
men had revered each other like brothers, and
often made monuments in each other’s
image where their paths had crossed.
Hence too, at the centre of
the Lindenhardt altar’s right wing,
that troubled gaze upon the youth
on the other side of the older man
whom, years ago now, on a grey
January morning I myself once
encountered in the railway station
in Bamberg. It is St. Dionysius,
his cut-off head under one arm.
To him, his chosen guardian
who in the midst of life carries
his death with him, Grünewald gives
the appearance of Riemenschneider, whom
twenty years later the Würzburg bishop
condemned to the breaking of his hands
in the torture cell. Long before that time
pain had entered into the pictures.
That is the command, knows the painter
who on the altar aligns himself
with the scant company of the
fourteen auxiliary saints. Each of these,
the blessed Blasius, Achaz and Eustace;
Panthaleon, Aegidius, Cyriax, Christopher and
Erasmus and the truly beautiful
St. Vitus with the cockerel,
each look in different
directions without knowing
why. The three female saints
Barbara, Catherine and Margaret on
the other hand hide at the edge
of the left panel behind the back of
St. George putting together their
uniform oriental heads for
a conspiracy against the men.
The misfortune of saints
is their sex, is the terrible
separation of the sexes which Grünewald
suffered in his own person. The exorcised
devil that Cyriax, not only because
of the narrow confines, holds raised
high as an emblem in
the air is a female being
and, as a grisaille of Grünewald’s
in the Frankfurt Städel shows in
the most drastic of fashions, derives from
Diocletian’s epileptic daughter,
the misshapen princess Artemia whom
Cyriax, as beside him she kneels on
the ground, holds tightly leashed
with a maniple of his vestments
like a dog. Spreading out
above them is the branch work
of a fig tree with fruit, one of which
is entirely hollowed out by insects.

At the point where the great military road
from Strasbourg to the Burgundian portal, in line with
the run of the Vosges to the south,
crosses the Lauterbach’s course
from the Gebweiler transverse valley,
lies the village of Isenheim.
Here the Canons Regular,
the legendary history of whose order
is traced back to the anchorite
Antonius the Hermit who
in the year 357 departed this life
in the Theban desert, in 1300
acquired the site from the Murbach
Cluniacs to found an Antonian hospital
for the cure of St. Anthony’s fire
which raged throughout all Europe,
an infection of the blood that led
to the rotting away of the limbs
and with leprosy was among
the most dreaded diseases of the Middle Ages.
When gradually St. Anthony’s fire
died, the Antonian hospitals adopted
other ailments that afflicted body or mind
for their healing, such as epilepsy
and the so-called venereal scourges
which spread disastrously after 1490.
The treatment of patients who at their arrival
were usually half-destroyed already
tended towards this, that, as
hieratic witnesses to evil,
at first they were led to the altar
in the choir aisle, baptised in the name
of a martyr to God and so, as it were
despite and together with their perversion,
brought into the precincts of salvation.
In this it happened not infrequently
that from the relic of St. Anthony
encased in the shrine of the altar
a miracle emanated, or that
those in some part horribly disfigured were
later rid of their affliction by the repeated
application of Saint Vinage, an elixir
which the canons obtained annually
on the day of the Resurrection in the monastery
of St. Antoine de Viennois,
near St. Marcellin on the Isère
by pouring wine on the bones,
there preserved, of St. Anthony.
This liquid, twice purified,
was distributed by the monastery’s messengers
up and down the country, and with it
the peasants blessed that pig which
in their sties wore the bell of the saint,
who was also the patron of flocks and their keepers.
As for the hospital itself, where
of the twelve canons eight
usually studied philosophy
under a lector,
the rituals of purification
according to which the sick were treated
became a battle fought over their bodies
against the presence of death manifested
in madness; became indeed the most
fundamental of all confrontations
in which the altar-work commissioned
from Grünewald by Guido Guersi,
the Isenheim Preceptor, was to engage
the painter in a great therapeutic
task through the representation,
executed in beauteous and harrowing
colours, of the hour of the pale
streams of pus. At the latest
with the commencement of his work
in the Alsatian Home of the Crippled
where the most diverse material for inspection
of the manners in which a human being
creeps into himself, herself or
seeks to get out, was assembled,
Grünewald, who in any case must have tended
towards an extremist view of the world,
will have come to see the redemption of the
living as one from life itself.
Now life as such, as it unfolds, dreadfully,
everywhere and at all times,
is not to be seen on the altar panels
whose figures have passed beyond
the miseries of existence, unless it be
in that unreal and demented thronging
which Grünewald has developed around
St. Anthony of the temptation:
dragged by his hair over the ground
by a gruesome monster.
Low down in the bottom-left corner
cowers the body, covered with
syphilitic chancres, of an inmate
of the Isenheim hospital. Above it
rises a two-headed and manyarmed
androgynous creature
about to finish off the saint
with a brandished jaw-bone.
On the right, a stilt-legged bird-like beast
which, with human arms,
holds a cudgel raised up. Behind
and beside this, towards the picture’s centre,
crab-clawed together, shark- and dragon-like
maws, rows of teeth, pug noses
from which snot flows, fin-shaped
clammy limp wings, hair and horns,
skin like entrails turned outwards,
excrescences of an entire life,
in the air, on land and in water.
To him, the painter, this is creation,
image of our insane presence
on the surface of the earth,
the regeneration proceeding
in downward orbits
whose parasitical shapes
intertwine, and, growing into
and out of one another, surge
as a demonic swarm
into the hermit’s quietude.
In this fashion Grünewald,
silently wielding his paintbrush,
rendered the scream, the wailing, the gurgling
and the shrieking of a pathological spectacle
to which he and his art, as he must have known,
themselves belong. The panic-stricken
kink in the neck to be seen
in all of Grünewald’s subjects,
exposing the throat and often turning
the face towards a blinding light,
is the extreme response of our bodies
to the absence of balance in nature
which blindly makes one experiment after another
and like a senseless botcher
undoes the thing it has only just achieved.
To try out how far it can go
is the sole aim of this sprouting,
perpetuation and proliferation
inside us also and through us and through
the machines sprung from our heads,
all in a single jumble,
while behind us already the green
trees are leaving their leaves and
bare, as often they appear in Grünewald’s
pictures, loom up into the sky,
the dead branches overlaid
with a moss-like glutinous substance.
The black bird that in its beak
carries a break-time meal
to St. Anthony on his site
in the desert may be the one with
the heart of glass, the bird
flying ever closer to us,
of which another prophet
of the last days announces
that it will shit into the sea
so that the water boils itself out,
that the earth trembles and the great city
with the iron tower stands in flames,
whilst the Pope squats in a barge
and darkness comes and
with it a yellow dust
that covers the land.

On the other side of the river, in the famous
botanical gardens of the Marine Hospital
Steller escapes the city’s bustle.
Neatly he walks the paths
between the flowerbeds, marvels at
the hothouses, filled with tropical plants,
learns one new name after another
and is almost beside himself
with so much hope
when, from the half-shadow
of the mustard tree by the aviary,
the Patriarch of Novgorod,
Archbishop Theophon, steps towards him
with a tiny yellow parakeet in his hand,
and in the course of a Latin conversation
tells him a legend from the region of Dolyi,
which relates that God quite suddenly
and as though out of the blue came
into being on a lungwort leaf.

Unending flights
of screeching birds, which skimmed
low over the water,
from afar resembled
drifting islands. Whales
rotated around the ship, emitting
water-spouts high into the air
in all directions of the compass.
Chamisso, who later marvelled at
the same spectacular sight
on the Romanzov expedition,
was led to think that perhaps
these animals could be tamed
and—no different from geese
on a stubble field—be herded
with a rod, as it were, on the sea.
Bring up the young in a fjord, he wrote,
fasten a spiked belt buoyed up by
air-bladders under their pectoral fins,
let them unlearn their submersions,
make experiments. Whether the whale is
then to draw or to carry,
whether and how it is harnessed
or laden, how it is bridled
or otherwise governed, and who is to be the
mahout of this water-elephant—all this
will settle itself in time. Chamisso,
it is true, also writes
of the steam engine as
the first warm-blooded animal
created by humankind.

At the break of the following day,
St. Elijah’s Day,
Steller went ashore. Ten hours
Bering, with dread already imprinted
on his brow, had granted him
for a scientific excursion.
Now a deep blueness
pervaded both water and the forests
that grew right down
to the coast. Unperturbed
animals came close to Steller, black
and red foxes, magpies too, jays and
crows went with him on his way
across the beach. In the translucent darkness
between the trees he moved
with a tread more like hovering
over a cushion of moss a foot thick.
He came close to simply proceeding
towards the mountains, into
cool wilderness, but the constructs
of science in his head,
directed towards a diminution
of disorder in our world,
ran counter to that need.
Later, in a shelter made
out of joined fir-logs, he experienced
the effect of forsaken things
in a foreign space. A circular
drinking vessel of peeled-off bark,
a whetstone dotted with copper ore,
a fish-head paddle and
a child’s rattle of fired clay
he carefully selects, and in their place
leaves behind an iron kettle, a string
of many-coloured beads,
a little strip of Bokhara silk,
half a pound of tobacco and
a Chinese clay pipe.
After half a century this mute
exchange is still remembered,
as can be seen in a report by Commander Billings,
by an inhabitant of this remote region
with a laugh that’s a rustling
turned inwards.

The advice of the officers was
to make for Avatsha, keeping the course
as close as practicable to the fifty-third parallel
after the unanimous decision
to forgo any further exploration,
a simple calculation that rested
on nothing but unknown factors.
For almost a quarter of a year
the ship was tossed hither and thither
by hurricanes of a force
none in the team could recall
ever having experienced, on the Bering Sea
where there was nothing and no one but them.
All was a greyness, without direction,
with no above or below, nature
in a process of dissolution, in a state
of pure dementia. For days, in between
lulls, the ship motionless and
ever more and more damaged,
more tattered, the rigging more threadbare,
the sailcloth eaten away by salt.
The crew, stricken with
the delirium that comes of diseases
that entered their bodies, with eyes
drowning in exhaustion,
gums swollen like sponges,
joints suffused with blood,
liver puffed up, spleen puffed up
and with ulcers festering
just under the skin, day after day in God’s name
flung overboard sailors rotted away, till at last
there was scarcely a difference between
the living and the dead.
In dying the astra in human bodies
lose their quality, kind, substance
and essence, Steller, the physician, thinks,
what is dead has ceased to be living.
What does it mean, this physica, he asks,
what this iusiurandum Hippocratis,
what does surgery mean, what is our
skill and use when life
breaks apart and the physician
has neither might nor means? There—
in the night—with the moon
in its first November quarter,
a great wall of water drives
the ship onto the rocks.
Jammed there it lies, groans
for a while amid boulders
as though in its last extremity
it might yet reach dry land,
until a heavy wave
pushes it down into the stillness
of the lagoon behind the reef.
A white sickle the strand
curves in the dark, inland
the dunes overgrown with grasses
up to a plateau of shadows
under mountains in snowlight,
phosphorescent.

At the moment on Ascension Day
of the year ’forty-four when I was born,
the procession for the blessing of the fields
was just passing our house to the sounds
of the fire brigade band, on its way out
to the flowering May meadows. Mother
at first took this as a happy sign, unaware
that the cold planet Saturn ruled this hour’s
constellation and that above the mountains
already the storm was hanging which soon thereafter
dispersed the supplicants and killed
one of the four canopy bearers.
Apart from the grievous impression this
occurrence, unprecedented in the village’s history,
may have made upon me, and apart from
the raging fire which one night—shortly
before my first day at school it was—
consumed a sawmill not far from our house
and lit up the whole valley, I grew up,
despite the dreadful course
of events elsewhere, on the northern
edge of the Alps, so it seems
to me now, without any
idea of destruction. But the habit
of often falling down in the street and
often sitting with bandaged hands
by the open window between the potted
fuchsias, waiting for the
pain to subside and for hours
doing nothing but looking out,
early on induced me to imagine
a silent catastrophe that occurs
almost unperceived.
What I thought up at the time,
while gazing down into the herb garden
in which the nuns under their white
starched hoods moved so slowly
between the beds as though a moment ago
they had still been caterpillars, this
I have never got over.
The emblem for me of the
scarcely identifiable disaster
since that time has been a stunted
Tatar with a red headcloth
and a white slightly curved
feather. In anthropology
this figure is often associated
with certain forms of self-mutilation
and described as that of the adept who
ascends a snow-covered mountain and long
tarries there, as they say, in tears.
In a sheltered corner
of his heart, so lately
I have read, he carries
a little horse made
of clay. Magical
crosswords he mumbles,
talks of scissor blades,
a thimble, a needle’s
eye, a stone in the memory,
a place of pilgrimage, and
of a small die, ice-coloured,
with a dash of Berlin blue.
A long series of tiny shocks,
from the first and the second pasts,
not translated into the spoken
language of the present, they
remain a broken corpus guarded
by Fungisi and the wolf’s shadow.
After that come the children grown
a little bigger who believe that
parts of their parents ride ahead
on the removal van’s horse
to make ready the living quarters,
while in the dark box
on the way to Gmunden
they eat their supper,
drink two pots of coffee,
spread butter on the bread
and say not a word about
either herring or radish. For months
Grandmother’s dying has now dragged on,
more and more water rising into her body
while in the village shop a poster
outlaws the yellowing
terror of Colorado beetles.
At the forest’s edge often a blackamoor
peered out of an American tank
and in the dark we saw
St. Elizabeth, lifting her skirts,
cautiously stepping over
red-hot ploughshares.
At school the beadle counted
his keys, Palm Sunday catkins
behind the crucifix chanted
their credo, and in the pencil case
on a scrap of paper already
the catchword of our dusty
future could be made out.
So one of us turned
into an innkeeper, the second
into a cook, the third into a waiter and
the fourth into nothing at all.
And from the hills we can see
the wispy shadows drifting
in Jehoshaphat’s Valley.
The magnetic needle, trembling,
points to the north, and I sense
a galvanic taste on my tongue,
a chemical miracle plated inside
with the finest horn silver.
The dreaded blackening
on certain parts
of the body confirms
the whole thing
most satisfactorily

In his excitement about the truly
boundless growth
of industry, the statesman
Disraeli called Manchester
the most wonderful city of modern times,
a celestial Jerusalem
whose significance only philosophy
could gauge. Half a life ago now
it is that, after leaving my remote home,
I arrived there and took lodging
among the previous century’s
ruins. Often at that time
I rambled over the fallow
Elysian Fields, wondering
at the work of destruction, the black
mills and shipping canals,
the disused viaducts and
warehouses, the many millions
of bricks, the traces of smoke,
of tar and sulphuric acid,
long have I stood on the banks
of the Irk and the Irwell, those
mythical rivers now dead,
which in better times
shone azure-blue,
carmine-red and glaucous green,
in their glow reflecting
the cotton clouds, those white ones
into which without a word the breath
of legions of human beings had been absorbed.
And the water carried them downstream
together with salt and ashes
through the marshland out
to the sea. Those silent mutations
clear the way to the future.
In the course of three generations
the working classes of Manchester
had become a race of pygmies.
Volunteers who in war-time attempted
to escape into military service
were rejected by the selection boards
as unfit, unless they could be accommodated
in one of the so-called bantam battalions
which recruited diminutive soldiers from the city
and throughout the surrounding area.
In either case they were
part of the obscure crowds
who fuelled the progress of history.
From my workplace I thought
I could see the will-o’-the-wisps
of their souls, as with tiny lanterns
they haunted the rubbish dumps
of the City Corporation, a smouldering
alpine range which, it seemed to me,
extended into the beyond.
In the dusk I often saw
searchlight beams from
bulldozers creeping about there
that pierced the void, and aeroplanes,
our grey primeval brothers,
rose with infinite slowness
from the lagoon and the bogs.
I recall that these images
often plunged me into a quasi
sublunary state of deep
melancholia and that then
I heard the incessant monotonous
vibrations of a Jew’s harp
and repeatedly had to step out
of doors in my oppression.
Whole days long in the basement
of the university library I read
the works of Paracelsus, in which
it is written that from septentrion
nothing good emanates and
that the body is dyed
by illness like a piece of cloth
by an extraneous colour.
Often on my wanderings
through the streets I resorted
to one of the many infernally
glittering hostelries, for preference
to Liston’s Music Hall
where a radiantly blue-eyed,
down-and-out heroic tenor,
who always wore a winter coat
too long for him and a Homburg hat,
sang Tannhäuser arias accompanied
by a Wurlitzer organ. And to
the Gospel Chapels I went
from time to time, witnessing
how row after row of the sick
amid the congregation’s shrieking
were healed and even the blind
had their sight restored.
Once, while searching
for the star-shaped Strangeways
Prison, an overwhelming
panoptic structure whose walls
are as high as Jericho’s, I found
myself in a sort of no-man’s-land
behind the railway buildings, in a terrace
of low houses apparently due
for demolition, with shops left vacant,
on whose boards the names
Goldblatt, Grünspan and Gottgetreu,
Spiegelhalter, Solomon, Waislfish
and Robinsohn could be made out.
In the wind a door moved
as if as a sign. Stuck to it
was an old placard
for the musical Oklahoma!
The entrance to nature’s theatre
stood open. I still strained
to hear the ethereal waves
when with martial brass music,
bugle horns and drums,
a procession of olive-green
child soldiers marched
down the street, passed
by me and suddenly vanished
as though swallowed by the earth.
If I told Mr. Deutsch
about these things
he shook his head
and said: “Strange, very
strange.” Mr. Deutsch,
born in Kufstein, had come
to England as a child
in nineteen thirty-eight.
There were many things he could not
remember; some others he could not erase
from his mind. He had never
mastered the English language
although for years, day in
and day out, he followed
on TV with an expression of
the utmost attention the entire
evening schedule, as if
at any moment he expected
a message that would
change his whole life.

When morning sets in,
the coolness of night
moves out into the plumage
of fishes, when once more
the air’s circumference
grows visible, then at times
I trust the quiet, resolve
to make a new start, an excursion
perhaps to a reserve of
camouflaged ornithologists.
Come, my daughter, come on,
give me your hand, we’re leaving
the town, I’ll show you the mill
set twice each day in motion
by the sea’s current,
a groaning miraculous construct
of wheels and belts
that carries water power
right into stone, right
into the trickling dust and
into the bodies of spiders.
The miller is friendly,
has clean white paws,
tells us all kinds of lore
to do with the story of flour.
A century ago Edward FitzGerald,
the translator of Omar Khayyám,
vanished out there. At an advanced age
one day he boarded his boat,
sailed off, with his top hat
tied on, into the German ocean
and was never seen again.
A great enigma, my child,
look, here are eleven barrows
for the dead and in the sixth
the impress of a ship with forty oars
long since gone, the grave of
Raedwald of Sutton Hoo.
Merovingian coins, Swedish
armour, Byzantine silver
the king took on his voyage,
and his warriors even now
on this sandy strip keep their weapons
hidden in grassy bunkers
behind earthworks, barbed wire
and pine plantations, one great
arsenal as far as your eye can see,
and nothing else but this sky,
the gorse scrub and now and then,
an old people’s home,
a prison or an asylum,
an institution for juvenile delinquents.
In orange jackets you see
the inmates labour
lined up across the moor.
Behind that the end
of the world, the five
cold houses of Shingle Street.
Inconsolable a woman
stands at the window,
a children’s swing
rusts in the wind, a lonely
spy sits in his Dormobile
in the dunes, his headphones
pulled over his ears.
No, here we can write
no postcards, can’t even
get out of the car. Tell me, child,
is your heart as heavy as
mine is, year after year
a pebble bank raised
by the waves of the sea
all the way to the North,
every stone a dead soul
and this sky so grey?
So unremittingly grey
and so low as no sky
I have seen before.
Along the horizon
freighters cross over
into another age
measured by the ticking
of Geigers in the power station
at Sizewell, where slowly
the core of the metal
is destroyed. Whispering
madness on the heathland
of Suffolk. Is this
the promis’d end? Oh,
you are men of stones.
What’s dead is gone
forever. What did’st
thou say? What,
how, where, when?
Is this love
nothing now
or all?
Water? Fire? Good?
Evil? Life? Death?

Lord, I dreamed
that to see Alexander’s battle
I flew all the way to
Munich. It was when darkness
crept in and far below me
I saw the roof of my house,
saw the shadows falling
on the East Anglian landscape,
I saw the rim of the island,
the waves lapping the shore
and in the North Sea the ships
motionless ahead of the foam-white wakes.
As a stingray hovers deep down
in the sea, so soundlessly I glided,
scarcely moving a wing,
high above the earth
over the Rhine’s alluvial plain
and followed upstream
the course of the water
grown heavy and bitter.
Cities phosphorescent
on the riverbank, industry’s
glowing piles waiting
beneath the smoke trails
like ocean giants for the siren’s
blare, the twitching lights
of rail- and motorways, the murmur
of the millionfold proliferating molluscs,
wood lice and leeches, the cold putrefaction,
the groans in the rocky ribs,
the mercury shine, the clouds that
chased through the towers of Frankfurt,
time stretched out and time speeded up,
all this raced through my mind
and was already so near the end
that every breath of air made my
face shudder. A high surf,
the mountain oaks roared on the slopes
of the Odenwald and then came a desert
and waste through whose valleys
the wind drove the dust
of stones. A twice-honed
sword divided the sky
from the earth, an effulgence flowed
into space, and the destination
of my excursion, the vision
of Altdorfer, opened up.
Far more than one hundred thousand,
so the inscriptions proclaim,
number the dead over whom
the battle surges for the salvation
of the Occident in the rays
of a setting sun. This is
the moment when destiny turns.
At the centre of the grandiose thronging
of banners and flags, lances and
pikes and batons, the breastplated
bodies of human beings and animals,
Alexander, the western world’s
hero, on his white horse
and before him in flight
towards the sickle moon
Darius, stark terror
visible in his face. As fortunate,
did the clever chaplain, who
had hung up an oleograph
of the battle scene beside
the blackboard describe the outcome
of this affair. It was,
he said, a demonstration
of the necessary destruction of all
the hordes coming up from the East,
and thus a contribution to the history
of salvation. Since then I have
read in another teacher’s writings
that we have death in front of us
rather like a picture of Alexander’s battle
on our schoolroom wall.
Now I know, as with a crane’s eye
one surveys his far-flung realm,
a truly Asiatic spectacle,
and slowly learns, from the tininess
of the figures and the incomprehensible
beauty of nature that vaults over them
to see that side of life that
one could not see before. We look
over the battle and, glancing
from north to south, we see
a camp with white Persian
tents lying in the evening glow
and a city on the shore.
Outside, with swollen sails
the ships make headway and
the shadows already graze
the cypresses, and beyond them
Egypt’s mainland extends.
