A bird came down the walk 
A cap of lead across the sky 
A charm invests a face 
A clock stoppednot the mantels 
A death-blow is a life-blow to some 
A deed knocks first at thought 
A dew sufficed itself 
A door just opened on a street 
Adrift! A little boat adrift! 
A drop fell on the apple tree 
Adventure most unto itself 
A face devoid of love or grace 
Afraid? Of whom am I afraid? 
After a hundred years 
Ah, Teneriffe! 
A lady red upon the hill 
A light exists in spring 
A little overflowing word 
A little madness in the Spring 
A little over Jordan 
A little road not made of man 
All circumstances are the frame 
All I may, if small 
All overgrown by cunning moss 
A long, long sleep, a famous sleep 
Alter? When the hills do 
Ambition cannot find him 
A modest lot, a fame petite 
Ample make this bed 
A murmur in the trees to note 
A narrow fellow in the grass 
An everywhere of silver 
An altered look about the hills 
An awful tempest mashed the air 
Angels in the early morning 
A poor torn heart, a tattered heart 
Apparently with no surprise 
A precious, mouldering pleasure t is 
A prompt, executive Bird is the Jay 
Arcturus is his other name 
Are friends delight or pain? 
A route of evanescence 
A sepal, petal, and a thorn 
A shady friend for torrid days 
A sickness of this world it most occasions 
As by the dead we love to sit 
As children bid the guest good-night 
As far from pity as complaint 
As if some little Arctic flower 
As imperceptibly as grief 
Ashes denote that fire was 
A sloop of amber slips away 
A solemn thing it was, I said 
A something in a summers day 
A spider sewed at night 
At half-past three a single bird 
A thought went up my mind to-day 
A throe upon the features 
At last to be identified! 
At least to pray is left, is left 
A toad can die of light! 
A train went through a burial gate 
A triumph may be of several kinds 
A word is dead 
A wounded deer leaps highest 

Beauty crowds me till I die 
Because I could not stop for Death 
Before I got my eye put out 
Before the ice is in the pools 
Before you thought of spring 
Belshazzar had a letter 
Bereaved of all, I went abroad 
Besides the autumn poets sing 
Blazing in gold and quenching in purple 
Bless God, he went as soldiers 
Bloom upon the Mountain, stated 
Bring me the sunset in a cup 

Candor, my tepid Friend 
Come slowly, Eden! 
Could I but ride indefinite 
Could mortal lip divine 
Crisis is sweet and, set of Heart 

Dare you see a soul at the white heat? 
Dear March, come in! 
Death is a dialogue between 
Death is like the insect 
Death sets a thing significant 
Delayed till she had ceased to know 
Delight becomes pictorial 
Departed to the judgment 
Did the harebell loose her girdle 
Distance is not the realm of Fox 
Doubt me, my dim companion! 
Down Times quaint stream 
Drab habitation of whom? 
Dropped into the 
Drowning is not so pitiful 
Dust is the only secret 

Each life converges to some centre 
Each that we lose takes part of us 
Eden is that old-fashioned House 
Elijahs wagon knew no thill 
Elysium is as far as to 
Essential oils are wrung 
Except the heaven had come so near 
Except the smaller size, no Lives are round 
Except to heaven, she is nought 
Exhilaration is the Breeze 
Experiment to me 
Exultation is the going 

Faith is a fine invention 
Fame is a fickle food 
Far from love the Heavenly Father 
Farther in summer than the birds 
Fate slew him, but he did not drop 
Father, I bring thee not myself 
Few get enough,enough is one 
Finite to fail, but infinite to venture 
Follow wise Orion 
Forbidden fruit a flavor has 
For Death,or rather 
For each ecstatic instant 
Forever cherished be the tree 
Frequently the woods are pink 
From all the jails the boys and girls 
From cocoon forth a butterfly 
From use she wandered now a year 
Give little anguish 
Given in marriage unto thee 
Glee! the great storm is over! 
Glory is that bright tragic thing 
Glowing is her Bonnet 
God gave a loaf to every bird 
God made a little gentian 
God permits industrious angels 
Going to heaven! 
Going to him! Happy letter! Tell him 
Good night! which put the candle out? 
Great streets of silence led away 
Had this one day not been 
Have you got a brook in your little heart 
Heart not so heavy as mine 
Heart, we will forget him! 
He ate and drank the precious words 
Heaven is what I cannot reach! 
Heavenly Father, take to thee 
He fumbles at your spirit 
He preached upon breadth 
He put the belt around my life 
Her final summer was it 
Her Grace is all she has 
Her Last Poems 
He touched me, so I live to know 
High from the earth I heard a bird 
His bill an auger is 
His Cheek is his Biographer 
His mind, of man a secret makes 
Hope is a subtle glutton 
Hope is the thing with feathers 
How dare the robins sing 
How destitute is he 
How happy is the little stone 
How many times these low feet staggered 
How still the bells in steeples stand 
How the old mountains drip with sunset 

I asked no other thing 
I bet with every Wind that blew 
I breathed enough to learn the trick 
I bring an unaccustomed wine 
I cant tell you, but you feel it 
I can wade grief 
I cannot live with you 
I did not reach thee 
I died for beauty, but was scarce 
I dreaded that first robin so 
I envy seas whereon he rides 
If anybodys friend be dead 
I felt a cleavage in my mind 
I felt a funeral in my brain 
If I can stop one heart from breaking 
If I could tell how glad I was 
If I may have it when it s dead 
If I should die 
If I should nt be alive 
I fit for them 
I found the phrase to every thought 
If pain for peace prepares 
If recollecting were forgetting 
If the foolish call them flowers 
If tolling bell I ask the cause 
If what we could were what we would 
If you were coming in the fall 
I gained it so 
I gave myself to him 
I had a daily bliss 
I had a guinea golden 
I had been hungry all the years 
I had no cause to be awake 
I had no time to hate, because 
I have a king who does not speak 
I have no life but this 
I have not told my garden yet 
I heard a fly buzz when I died 
I held a jewel in my fingers 
I hide myself within my flower 
I know a place where summer strives 
I know some lonely houses off the road 
I know that he exists 
I like a look of agony 
I like to see it lap the miles 
I live with him, I see his face 
I lived on dread; to those who know 
I ll tell you how the sun rose 
I lost a world the other day 
I many times thought peace had come 
I m ceded, I ve stopped being theirs 
I meant to find her when I came 
I meant to have but modest needs 
I measure every grief I meet 
Immortal is an ample word 
Immured in Heaven! What a Cell! 
I m nobody! Who are you? 
I m thinking of that other morn 
I m wife; I ve finished that 
I never hear the word escape 
I never lost as much but twice 
I never saw a moor 
I never told the buried gold 
In lands I never saw, they say 
I noticed people disappeared 
In winter, in my room 
I read my sentence steadily 
I reason, earth is short 
Is bliss, then, such abyss 
I see thee better in the dark 
I send two Sunsets 
I shall know why, when time is over 
Is Heaven a physician? 
I should have been too glad, I see 
I should not dare to leave my friend 
I showed her heights she never saw 
I sing to use the waiting 
I started early, took my dog 
I stepped from plank to plank 
It cant be summer,that got through 
It dropped so low in my regard 
It makes no difference abroad 
It might be easier 
It s all I have to bring to-day 
It sifts from leaden sieves 
It s like the light 
It sounded as if the streets were running 
It s such a little thing to weep 
It struck me every day 
It tossed and tossed 
It was not death, for I stood up 
It was too late for man 
I taste a liquor never brewed 
I think just how my shape will rise 
I think that the root of the Wind is Water 
I think the hemlock likes to stand 
I took my power in my hand 
I ve got an arrow here 
I ve seen a dying eye 
I watched her face to see which way 
I went to heaven 
I went to thank her 
I wish I knew that womans name 
I wonder if the sepulchre 
I worked for chaff, and earning wheat 
I years had been from home 

Just lost when I was saved! 
Just so, Jesus rapsHe does not weary 

Lay this laurel on the one 
Let down the bars, O Death! 
Let me not mar that perfect dream 
Life, and Death, and Giants 
Lightly stepped a yellow star 
Like brooms of steel 
Like Men and Women shadows walk 
Like mighty footlights burned the red 
Like some old-fashioned miracle 
Like trains of cars on tracks of plush 
Look back on time with kindly eyes 
Love is anterior to life 
Love reckons by itself alone 
Low at my problem bending 

March is the month of expectation 
Me! Come! My dazzled face 
Mine by the right of the white election! 
Mine enemy is growing old 
Morning is the place for dew 
Morning means Milking to the Farmer 
Morns like these we parted 
Much madness is divinest sense 
Musicians wrestle everywhere 
My cocoon tightens, colors tease 
My country need not change her gown 
My friend must be a bird 
My life closed twice before its close 
My nosegays are for captives 
My river runs to thee 
My Wheel is in the dark 
My worthiness is all my doubt 

Nature is what we see 
Nature rarer uses yellow 
Nature, the gentlest mother 
New feet within my garden go 
No Autumns intercepting chill 
No brigadier throughout the year 
No matter where the Saints abide 
No other can reduce 
No rack can torture me 
No romance sold unto 
Not any higher stands the grave 
Not any sunny tone 
Not in this world to see his face 
Not knowing when the dawn will come 
Not one by Heaven defrauded stay 
Not when we know 
Not with a club the heart is broken 

Of tribulation these are they 
Of all the souls that stand create 
Of all the sounds despatched abroad 
Of bronze and blaze 
Of Death the sharpest function 
Of so divine a loss 
Of this is Day composed 
One blessing had I, than the rest 
One day is there of the series 
One dignity delays for all 
One need not be a chamber to be haunted 
One of the ones that Midas touched 
One sister have I in our house 
On my volcano grows the grass 
On such a night, or such a night 
On the bleakness of my lot 
On this long storm the rainbow rose 
On this wondrous sea 
Our journey had advanced 
Our lives are Swiss 
Our share of night to bear 

Pain has an element of blank 
Papa above! 
Perception of an 
Perhaps youd like to buy a flower? 
Peril as a possession 
Pigmy seraphs gone astray 
Pink, small, and punctual 
Pompless no life can pass away 
Poor little heart! 
Portraits are to daily faces 
Prayer is the little implement 
Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn 
Proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it 

Read, sweet, how others strove 
Remember me, implored the Thief 
Remembrance has a rear and front 
Remorse is memory awake 
Reverse cannot befall that fine Prosperity 

Safe Despair it is that raves 
Safe in their alabaster chambers 
She died at play 
She died,this was the way she died 
She laid her docile crescent down 
She rose to his requirement, dropped 
She slept beneath a tree 
She sweeps with many-colored brooms 
She went as quiet as the dew 
Sleep is supposed to be 
So bashful when I spied her 
So, from the mould 
Softened by Times consummate plush 
So gay a flower bereaved the mind 
Some Days retired from the rest 
Some keep the Sabbath going to church 
Some rainbow coming from the fair! 
Some things that fly there be 
Some, too fragile for winter winds 
So proud she was to die 
So set its sun in thee 
Soul, wilt thou toss again? 
South winds jostle them 
Sown in dishonor? 
Speech is a symptom of affection 
Split the lark and you ll find the music 
Step lightly on this narrow spot! 
Success is counted sweetest 
Summer begins to have the look 
Summer for thee grant I may be 
Superfluous were the sun 
Superiority to fate 
Surgeons must be very careful 
Sweet hours have perished here 
Sweet is the swamp with its secrets 

Taken from men this morning 
Talk with prudence to a beggar 
T is an honorable thought 
T is little I could care for pearls 
T is so much joy! 
T is sunrise, little maid, hast thou 
T is whiter than an Indian pipe 
That I did always love 
That is solemn we have ended 
That Love is all there is 
That she forgot me was the least 
That short, potential stir 
That such have died enables us 
The bat is dun with wrinkled wings 
The bee is not afraid of me 
The Bible is an antique volume 
The blunder is to estimate 
The body grows outside 
The bone that has no marrow 
The brain is wider than the sky 
The brain within its groove 
The bustle in a house 
The butterflys assumption-gown 
The butterfly obtains 
The clouds their backs together laid 
The cricket sang 
The daisy follows soft the sun 
The day came slow, till five oclock 
The Devil, had he fidelity 
The difference between despair 
The distance that the dead have gone 
The Duties of the Wind are few 
The dying need but little, dear 
The Face we choose to miss 
The farthest thunder that I heard 
The feet of people walking home 
The Future never spoke 
The gentian weaves her fringes 
The gleam of an heroic act 
The grass so little has to do 
The grave my little cottage is 
The healed Heart shows its shallow scar 
The heart asks pleasure first 
The Hills erect their purple heads 
The incidents of Love 
The inundation of the Spring 
Their height in heaven comforts not 
The largest fire ever known 
The last night that she lived 
The leaves, like women, interchange 
The long sigh of the Frog 
The Look of Thee, what is it like? 
The luxury to apprehend 
The missing All prevented me 
The Moon upon her fluent route 
The moon is distant from the sea 
The moon was but a chin of gold 
The morns are meeker than they were 
The mountain sat upon the plain 
The murmur of a bee 
The murmuring of bees has ceased 
The mushroom is the elf of plants 
The nearest dream recedes, unrealized 
The night was wide, and furnished scant 
The one that could repeat the summer day 
The Ones that disappeared are back 
The only ghost I ever saw 
The overtakelessness of those 
The past is such a curious creature 
The pedigree of honey 
The props assist the house 
The rat is the concisest tenant 
There s something quieter than sleep 
There came a day at summers full 
There came a wind like a bugle 
There is a flower that bees prefer 
There is a shame of nobleness 
There is a solitude of space 
There is a word 
There is another Loneliness 
There is no frigate like a book 
Theres a certain slant of light 
Theres been a death in the opposite house 
The reticent volcano keeps 
The right to perish might be thought 
The robin is the one 
The rose did caper on her cheek 
These are the days that Reindeer love 
These are the days when birds come back 
The Sea said Come to the Brook 
The show is not the show 
The skies cant keep their secret! 
The sky is low, the clouds are mean 
The Soul that has a Guest 
The soul selects her own society 
The soul should always stand ajar 
The Souls superior instants 
The soul unto itself 
The spider as an artist 
The springtimes pallid landscape 
The Stars are old, that stood for me 
The stimulus, beyond the grave 
The suburbs of a secret 
The sun just touched the morning 
The sun kept setting, setting still 
The sweets of Pillage can be known 
The thought beneath so slight a film 
The treason of an accent 
The way I read a letters this 
The wind begun to rock the grass 
The wind tapped like a tired man 
The Winds drew off 
They wont frown alwayssome sweet day 
They dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars 
They say that time assuages 
This is my letter to the world 
This is the land the sunset washes 
This merit hath the worst 
This quiet Dust was Gentlemen and Ladies 
This was in the white of the year 
This world is not conclusion 
Those final Creatures,who they are 
Though I get home how late, how late! 
Three weeks passed since I had seen her 
Through lane it lay, through bramble 
Through the straight pass of suffering 
Tie the strings to my life, my Lord 
Title divine is mine 
To be alive is power 
To-day or this noon 
To fight aloud is very brave 
To hang our head ostensibly 
To hear an oriole sing 
To help our bleaker parts 
To know just how he suffered would be dear 
To learn the transport by the pain 
To lose ones faith surpasses 
To lose thee, sweeter than to gain 
To love thee, year by year 
To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee 
To my quick ear the leaves conferred 
Too cold is this 
To pile like Thunder to its close 
To see her is a picture 
To tell the beauty would decrease 
To the staunch Dust we safe commit thee 
To this apartment deep 
To venerate the simple days 
T was a long parting, but the time 
T was comfort in her dying room 
T was just this time last year I died 
T was later when the summer went 
T was such a little, little boat 
Two butterflies went out at noon 
Two lengths has every day 
Two swimmers wrestled on the spar 

Undue significance a starving man attaches 
Unto my books so good to turn 
Upon the gallows hung a wretch 

Victory comes late 
Volcanoes be in Sicily 

Wait till the majesty of Death 
Water is taught by thirst 
We cover thee, sweet face 
We learn in the retreating 
We like March, his shoes are purple 
We never know how high we are 
We never know we go,when we are going 
Went up a year this evening! 
We outgrow love like other things 
We play at paste 
We should not mind so small a flower 
We spy the Forests and the Hills 
We thirst at first,t is Natures act 
What if I say I shall not wait? 
What inn is this 
What mystery pervades a well! 
What soft, cherubic creatures 
When Etna basks and purrs 
When I hoped I feared 
When I was small, a woman died 
When night is almost done 
When roses cease to bloom, dear 
Where every bird is bold to go 
Where ships of purple gently toss 
Whether my bark went down at sea 
While I was fearing it, it came 
Who has not found the heaven below 
Who is it seeks my pillow nights? 
Who never wanted,maddest joy 
Who never lost, are unprepared 
Who robbed the woods 
Whose are the little beds, I asked 
Who were the Father and the Son 
Wild nights! Wild nights! 
Will there really be a morning? 
Witchcraft has not a pedigree 
Within my reach! 
You cannot put a fire out 
You left me, sweet, two legacies 
Your riches taught me poverty 
You ve seen balloons set, havent you?
