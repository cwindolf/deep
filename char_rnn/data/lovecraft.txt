Where bay and river tranquil blend,
And leafy hillsides rise,
The spires of Providence ascend
Against the ancient skies.

Here centuried domes of shining gold
Salute the mornings glare,
While slanting gables, odd and old,
Are scatterd here and there.

And in the narrow winding ways
That climb oer slope and crest,
The magic of forgotten days
May still be found to rest.

A fanlights gleam, a knockers blow,
A glimpse of Georgian brick
The sights and sounds of long ago
Where fancies cluster thick.

A flight of steps with iron rail,
A belfry looming tall,
A slender steeple, carvd and pale,
A moss-grown garden wall.

A hidden churchyards crumbling proofs
Of mans mortality,
A rotting wharf where gambrel roofs
Keep watch above the sea.

Square and parade, whose walls have towerd
Full fifteen decades long
By cobbled ways mid trees embowerd,
And slighted by the throng.

Stone bridges spanning languid streams,
Houses perchd on the hill,
And courts where mysteries and dreams
The brooding spirit fill.

Steep alley steps by vines conceald,
Where small-pand windows glow
At twilight on a bit of field
That chance has left below.

My Providence! What airy hosts
Turn still thy gilded vanes;
What winds of elf that with grey ghosts
People thine ancient lanes!

The chimes of evening as of old
Above thy valleys sound,
While thy stern fathers neath the mould
Make blest thy sacred ground.

Thou dreamst beside the waters there,
Unchangd by cruel years;
A spirit from an age more fair
That shines behind our tears.

Thy twinkling lights each night I see,
Tho time and space divide;
For thou art of the soul of me,
And always at my side!
