That first year we rented an apartment in Fox Point
& our sons turned two. A month later, the day
their sister turned one, I watched her bounce
on an inflatable globe of our world on which,
upon further examination, our small state did
not appear. It was July, so humid, that birthday
morning, sweat already dripped into my eyes only
minutes after a shower, & I remember thinking
of small, unseen states of grace: two-year old twin
sons, a daughter turning one, her body wrapped
around her buoyant world, making iced coffee
for their mother, showering upstairs, herself
about to step into the soft, wet air we call,
Rhode Island summer, thinking how lucky
we were to be in this small &, apparently
even to some mapmakers, unremarkable,
unremarked-upon, state. Even now they
say, about the size of Rhode Island, meaning
a county or city elsewhere in the country
the size of a whole state, or a place
so small it can almost, by some people
at leastamong them map- & globe-makers
be missed. Feeling, even then, so alive &
lucky to be in this state of firsts: most
tolerant of original colonies, first Baptist
church (1638), first synagogue built
in America (1763), first jail sentence
for speeding in an automobile (1904;
15 miles an hour, in Newport, by the way),
first, some might say, most sustained, circus
(1774). (2014): our first woman Governor.
The big-top of our states house is home
to the statue called, Hope, also known as
the independent man, model for such
an idea being near at hand, the man
Jefferson and Adams said informed
the first Amendment, Roger Williams standing tall
for free speech & religion long before others did.
Thinking again of the globe, on which this more
enlightened state appears, state-house housing
now an independent woman, how long some
things take, some states of grace, a woman leading
the way for once, how, as our new governor says,
what isnt already here we will have to map & make
ourselves, this place we most want to live & love in,
making new room & space, even among founding
fathers, for a state just small enough for big changes to begin.
